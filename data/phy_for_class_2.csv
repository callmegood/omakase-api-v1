We rarely stop to consider where they come from. But we should. In The World for Sale, two leading journalists lift the lid on one of the least scrutinised corners of the economy: the workings of the billionaire commodity traders who buy, hoard and sell the earth's resources. It is the story of how a handful of swashbuckling businessmen became indispensable cogs in global markets: enabling an enormous expansion in international trade, and connecting resource-rich countries - no matter how corrupt or war-torn - with the world's financial centres. And it is the story of how some traders acquired untold political power, right under the noses of Western regulators and politicians - helping Saddam Hussein to sell his oil, fuelling the Libyan rebel army during the Arab Spring, and funnelling cash to Vladimir Putin's Kremlin in spite of strict sanctions. The result is an eye-opening tour through the wildest frontiers of the global economy, as well as a revelatory guide to how capitalism really works.||v, 410 pages : illustration, maps ; 25 cm||382.0|BOOK - Book|2021|2020-07-09|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781847942654?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Le51ygEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

As Desmond was growing up, he vowed his life would be different. Through hard work and sheer tenacity Shum earned an American college degree and returned to China to establish himself in business. There, he met his future wife, the highly intelligent and equally ambitious Whitney Duan who was determined to make her mark within China's male-dominated society. Whitney and Desmond formed an effective team and, aided by relationships they formed with top members of the red aristocracy, vaulted into China's billionaire class. Soon they were developing the massive air cargo facility at Beijing International Airport, and they followed that feat with the creation of one of Beijing's premier hotels. They were dazzlingly successful, traveling in private jets, funding multi-million-dollar buildings and endowments, and purchasing expensive homes, vehicles, and art. But in 2017, their fates diverged irrevocably when Desmond, while residing overseas with his son, learned that his now ex-wife Whitney had vanished along with three coworkers. This is both Desmond's story and Whitney's, because she cannot tell it herself.|Paperback edition published in 2022 with ISBN 9781398510388.|310 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations (some color), portraits ; 24 cm||338.092|BOOK - Book|2021|2021-09-07|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781398510371?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qGNqzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Bullying has replaced diplomacy, and China is increasingly willing to use coercion to get its way. Trade, investment, even big-spending tourists and students have been weaponised. The Communist Party believes it is fighting an ideological war on multiple fronts and is acting with increasing belligerence and impunity. China's goal of recovering Taiwan - regarded as a renegade province since the end of the civil war in 1949 - is one of the obvious flashpoints for a Third World War, but its aggressive foreign policy is playing out in multiple locations. Cambodia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia are increasingly beholden to China; the border clash with India in 2020 was the most serious since 1962; and its neo-colonial enterprises in Africa have created ever-increasing indebtedness and dependence. In this thought-provoking and alarming book, veteran China specialist and foreign correspondent Ian Williams examines how China's aggressive foreign policy is arguably the biggest threat to our security and is a problem that not just the West - but the rest of the world - ignores at its peril--Publisher's description.||vi, 358 pages : maps ; 24 cm||327.51|BOOK - Book|2022.|2022-11-10|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781780277813?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4RTwzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Many observers misread Xi during his early years in power, projecting their own hopes that he would steer China toward more political openness, rule of law, and pro-market economics. Having masked his beliefs while climbing the party hierarchy, Xi has centralized decision-making powers, encouraged a cult of personality around himself, and moved toward indefinite rule by scrapping presidential term limits--stirring fears of a return to a Mao-style dictatorship. Today, the party of Xi favors political zeal over technical expertise, trumpets its faith in Marxism, and proclaims its reach into every corner of Chinese society with Xi portraits and hammer-and-sickle logos. Under Xi, China has challenged Western preeminence in global affairs and cast its authoritarian system as a model of governance worthy of international emulation. As a China reporter for the Wall Street Journal, Chun Han Wong has chronicled Xi Jinping's hard-line strategy for crushing dissent against his strongman rule, his political repression in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, and his increasingly coercive efforts to reel in the island democracy of Taiwan, as well as the domestic and diplomatic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. When the Chinese government refused to renew Wong's press credentials and forced him to leave mainland China in 2019, he moved to Hong Kong to continue covering Chinese politics and its autocratic turn under Xi. Now, Wong has drawn on his years of firsthand reporting across China--including conversations with party insiders, insights from scholars and diplomats, and analyses of official speeches and documents--to create a lucid and historically rooted account of China's leader and how he inspires fear and fervor in his party, his nation, and beyond.||xvi, 395 pages : illustrations, map, ; 24 cm||951.061|BOOK - Book|2023.|2023-05-23|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781982185732?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5krAEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Tim Marshall's global bestseller Prisoners of Geography showed how every nation's choices are limited by mountains, rivers, seas and concrete. Since then, the geography hasn't changed, but the world has. In this revelatory new book, Marshall takes us into ten regions that are set to shape global politics and power. Find out why the Earth's atmosphere is the world's next battleground; why the fight for the Pacific is just beginning; and why Europe's next refugee crisis is closer than it thinks. In ten chapters covering Australia, The Sahel, Greece, Turkey, the UK, Iran, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, Spain and Space, delivered with Marshall's trademark wit and insight, this is a lucid and gripping exploration of the power of geography to shape humanity's past, present -- and future.||xvii, 380 pages : maps ; 20 cm.||320.12|BOOK - Book|2021|2021-10|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781783966028?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OVZczgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The Sackler name adorns the walls of many storied institutions - Harvard; the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Oxford; the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations in the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing Oxycontin, a blockbuster painkiller that was a catalyst for the opioid crisis-an international epidemic of drug addiction which has killed nearly half a million people. In this masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, Patrick Radden Keefe exhaustively documents the jaw-dropping and ferociously compelling reality.

In this illustrated history, bestselling historian Dr Michael Lynch examines how the long struggle between Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists and Mao Zedong's Communists exploded into an intense, brutal and ruthlessly fought civil war. Delving into the political background and complex ramifications of the conflict, he assesses Mao and Chiang's millions-strong armies, their strategies and commanders, and the critical campaigns that won and lost China. By 1949 the Nationalist government was defeated and in exile in Taiwan, and the new People's Republic of China was ready to emerge as a major Cold War power.  Updated and revised for the new edition, with full-colour maps and new images throughout, this is a concise study of one of the bloodiest conflicts of the 20th century and its significant repercussions, the issues around which remain unresolved today--Back cover.|The text in this edition is revised and updated from: ESS 61: The Chinese Civil War 1945-49 (Osprey Publishing, 2010)--Title page verso.|144 pages : illustrations (some colour), colour maps ; 21 cm.||951.042|BOOK - Book|2022.|2022-09-13|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781472853141?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w2-JEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

A major trade war has broken out. American and Chinese naval vessels are having close encounters in the South China Sea. American congressmen and businessmen are cheering their government's public attacks on China. China is standing firm and resolute. Who will win this contest? What is at stake? And who will judge the winner? In this book, Kishore Mahbubani evaluates the two sides, and shows how China has been thinking on a global scale, launching ambitious initiatives under some of the world's most pragmatic and competent leaders. Most critically, the Chinese people have regained their cultural confidence. Chinese society is now infused with innovation and dynamism. Meanwhile, America has seen the power of its economic model badly damaged by the 2008 financial crisis. To many it is no longer the indispensable nation but an awkward interloper. The global rise of China and the relative strategic decline of the US presents a political challenge that the US has never faced before. American policymakers must shake off their complacency and launch a major strategic reboot of both domestic and foreign policies that have weakened the nation's social foundations and global standing. Otherwise, the start-up nation, barely two hundred and fifty years old, with only a quarter of China's population, cannot expect to defeat the world's oldest continuous civilization. With his trademark candor, Mahbubani delivers impartial and incisive insights on the strategic stakes and mistakes in this new great game-- Provided by publisher.||vii, 310 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm||327.51|BOOK - Book|2020.|2020|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781541758674?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sDyezQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

For millions of people around the world Messi or Ronaldo? isn't simply a barroom argument, or an affirmation of fandom, so much as a statement of philosophy, of values, of what global soccer is today and of what it will be tomorrow. Now Wall Street Journal reporters and co-authors of The Club, Joshua Robinson and Jonathan Clegg, unite the stories of Messi and Ronaldo into a single modern epic of global sports, detailing how one rivalry changed both the game and the business of international soccer--forever. Based on dozens of firsthand accounts and years of original reporting, Messi vs. Ronaldo weaves together the stakes, color, and characters at the heart of each man's story, going inside the locker rooms and boardrooms where their legends were forged and revealing off-field drama as gripping as anything that happened on it. From their contrasting origin stories to their divergent career arcs and their conflicting reputations, these players have built their successes on opposite paths, yet each, in his own way, offers a riveting tale of triumph and excess. Taken together, their story embodies the astronomical growth of international soccer, how social media has revolutionized the power of sports celebrity, and how the desire to capitalize on the billions of dollars these players represent electrified some of the most storied clubs in Europe--Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Manchester United among them--and cost them almost everything. With the 2022 World Cup almost certain to be the last for both of these figures, Messi vs. Ronaldo offers a deeply researched look at their legacy and grapples with the impact that their talents have had on the game for better and for worse. Much more than a retelling of the dual accomplishments of these great players, this is truly a biography of a rivalry, one that has become a crucial lens for understanding the past, present, and future of global soccer--Provided by publisher.||xi, 307 pages ; 24 cm||796.334|BOOK - Book|[2022]|2022-11-08|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780063157170?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vtPvzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

These are dangerous times for democracy. We live in an age of winners and losers, where the odds are stacked in favor of the already fortunate. Stalled social mobility and entrenched inequality give the lie to the American credo that 'you can make it if you try'. The consequence is a brew of anger and frustration that has fueled populist protest and extreme polarization, and led to deep distrust of both government and our fellow citizens--leaving us morally unprepared to face the profound challenges of our time. World-renowned philosopher Michael J. Sandel argues that to overcome the crises that are upending our world, we must rethink the attitudes toward success and failure that have accompanied globalization and rising inequality. Sandel shows the hubris a meritocracy generates among the winners and the harsh judgment it imposes on those left behind, and traces the dire consequences across a wide swath of American life. He offers an alternative way of thinking about success--more attentive to the role of luck in human affairs, more conducive to an ethic of humility and solidarity, and more affirming of the dignity of work. The Tyranny of Merit points us toward a hopeful vision of a new politics of the common good--Provided by publisher.||272 pages ; 24 cm||306.097|BOOK - Book|2021|2021|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780141991177?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PJ8bzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Cha, Ramon Pacheco Pardo|Korea History Japanese occupation, 1910-1945., Korea History 1945-, Korea (North) History., Korea (South) History., Pacheco Pardo, Ramon. author.|History|Korea has a long, riveting history--it is also a divided nation. South Korea is a vibrant democracy, the tenth largest economy, and is home to a world-renowned culture. North Korea is ruled by the most authoritarian regime in the world, a poor country in a rich region, and is best known for the cult of personality surrounding the ruling Kim family. But both Koreas share a unique common history. Victor Cha and Ramon Pacheco Pardo draw on decades of research to explore the history of modern Korea, from the late nineteenth century, Japanese occupation, and Cold War division to the present day. A small country caught amongst the world's largest powers--including China, Japan, Russia, and the United States--Korea's fate has been closely connected to its geography and the strength of its leadership and society. This comprehensive history sheds light on the evolving identities of the two Koreas, explaining the sharp differences between North and South, and prospects for unification.--Dust jacket.||xix, 268 pages, 16 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations (some color), map ; 24 cm||951.904|BOOK - Book|[2023]|2023-01-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780300259810?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7kbCEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It rests on a seismic fault of cultural misunderstanding, historical grievance, and ideological incompatibility. No other nations are so quick to offend and be offended. Their militaries play a dangerous game of chicken, corporations steal intellectual property, intelligence satellites peer and AI technicians plot. The capacity for either country to cross a fatal line grows daily. Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who has studied, lived in, and worked with China for more than forty years, is one of the very few people who can offer real insight into the mindsets of the leadership whose judgement will determine if a war will be fought. This book demystifies the actions of both sides, explaining and translating them for the benefit of the other. Geopolitical disaster is still avoidable, but only if these two giants can find a way to coexist without betraying their core interests through what Rudd calls managed strategic competition. Should they fail, down that path lies the possibility of a war that could rewrite the future of both countries, and the world.||x, 420 pages ; 24 cm.||327.51|BOOK - Book|2022.|2022-03-30|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780733648502?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FlG4zgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

A world in which China asserts the same level of global leadership that America currently assumes? And can we learn to embrace Chinese political culture, as China learned to embrace ours? Here, one of the world's leading voices on China, Kerry Brown, takes us past the tired cliches and inside the Chinese leadership - as they lay out a roadmap for working in a world in which China shares dominance with the West. From how, and why, China as a dominant superpower has been inevitable for many years, to how the attempts to fight the old battles are over, Brown digs deeper into the problematic nature of China's current situation - its treatment of dissent, of Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and the severe limitations on its management of relations with other cultures and values. These issues impact on the way the West sees China, China sees the West, and how both see themselves. There are obstacles accepting a place for China in the world - but just because this will be a difficult process does not mean that it should not happen.

Providing an astute analysis of Israel's unique policies and culture, and practical conclusions about how other nations could learn from its example, Start-Up Nation became a worldwide bestseller, translated into thirty languages. Now in their illuminating follow-up, The Genius of Israel, Senor and Singer study the global innovation race and present a new universal metric to evaluate where different nations stand in the quest to achieve new levels of innovation. They analyze the favorable and unfavorable circumstances that affect a country's chance of making a dramatic leap forward, and illustrate how the world has greatly changed over the last decade.

After escaping an arranged marriage with a noble cousin, Olive Yang felt that she had no choice but to lead a life of banditry with an anti-communist rebel army supported by the CIA. As her smuggling empire grew, she became powerful and infamous: novelists were inspired to write about her evil ruthlessness and beauty. To the Kokang people whom the Yang family once ruled, Olive was both folk-hero and villain. To the communists Olive's men harassed, she was the saboteur of the historic Sino-Burmese border agreement. To the generals who jailed her at the dawn of the Burmese military era, she was a national security threat. Through interviews with the Yang family, Olive emerges as a complex anti-hero, searching for a way to live as an open homosexual in an era when such a lifestyle was considered deeply shameful in Burma. The great military alliances that facilitate narcotics traffic in Myanmar today are Olive's lasting legacy in the Golden Triangle, as is the disenfranchisement of the people of Kokang.  -- adapted from jacket||xv, 219 pages : illustrations, maps ; 24 cm||959.051|BOOK - Book|[2023]|2022-12-15|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781538131978?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7I-_zgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

When Pavlov introduced scientific approaches, his research was enthusiastically supported by Lenin and Stalin, setting the stage for major breakthroughs in tools for social, political, and religious control. Tracing these developments through many of the past century's major conflagrations, Dimsdale narrates how when World War II erupted, governments secretly raced to develop drugs for interrogation. Brainwashing returned to the spotlight during the Cold War in the hands of the North Koreans and Chinese. In response, a huge Manhattan Project of the Mind was established to study memory obliteration, indoctrination during sleep, and hallucinogens. Cults used the techniques as well.

Dr. David Daokui Li has served as an advisor to senior Chinese Communist Party leaders as well as major multinational corporations and international economic institutions. Writing in response to the growing anti-Chinese sentiment and alarmed by the threat of war, Dr. Li pulls from his wealth of firsthand experience to demystify contemporary Chinese society and advocate for understanding between China and the West. In this urgently needed and fascinating book, he explains the inner workings of a rising superpower to help the world understand how it works--and how to work with it. In Li's hands, an economic and political system that often baffles Westerners becomes coherent, sophisticated, and logical. He begins by explaining how two thousand years of history--from Confucian philosophy and ancient imperial dynasties to Communist Party chairmen from Mao to Deng Xiaoping--profoundly influence China's leadership today. Li brings the reader into high-level meetings he attended with figures including Xi Jinping, showing China's approach to governance. Many Westerners imagine that China's economy and society are as rigid and ideological as Soviet Russia. In his far-reaching exploration of the Chinese economy--from state-owned enterprises, private businesses, the stock market, education, media and the internet to real estate, the environment, and much more--Li reveals that China's economy and society are in fact diverse, dynamic, and flexible. In demystifying contemporary Chinese society, Li helps readers reconceptualize contemporary China and the implications of its growth. He asserts that China's rise will be beneficial for the global order, holding out the hope that with shared understanding and mutual learning the Chinese and Western systems will eventually find a way to peacefully coexist--Goodreads.|Includes index.|278 pages ; 24 cm||381.095|BOOK - Book|[2024]||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780393292398?s=MD|

Focusing primarily on Plan D (Dalet, in Hebrew), conceived on March 10, 1948, Pappe demonstrates how ethnic cleansing was not a circumstance of war, but rather a deliberate goal of combat for early Israeli military units led by David Ben-Gurion, whom Pappe labels the architect of ethnic cleansing. The forced expulsion of 800,000 Palestinians between 1948-49, Pappe argues, was part of a long-standing Zionist plan to manufacture an ethnically pure Jewish state. Framing his argument with accepted international and UN definitions of ethnic cleansing, Pappe follows with an excruciatingly detailed account of Israeli military involvement in the demolition and depopulation of hundreds of villages, and the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Arab inhabitants. An accessible, learned resource, this volume provides important inroads into the historical antecedents of today's conflict, but its conclusions will not be easy for everyone to stomach: Pappe argues that the ethnic cleansing of Palestine continues today, and calls for the unconditional return of all Palestinian refugees and an end to the Israeli occupation. Without question, Pappe's account will provoke ire from many readers; importantly, it will spark discussion as well. - Publisher's description.|Originally published: 2006., Reprinted 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017--(verso of title page).|xviii, 313 pages, [16] pages of plates : illustrations, maps ; 20 cm||956.94|BOOK - Book|2007.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781851685554?s=MD|

Davies ; preface by Katrina Vanden Heuvel.||Benjamin, Medea|Benjamin, Medea||Russo-Ukrainian War, 2014-, Ukraine Foreign relations Russia (Federation), Russia (Federation) Foreign relations Ukraine., Davies, Nicolas J. S., author., Vanden Heuvel, Katrina, writer of preface.||Russia's brutal February 2022 invasion of Ukraine has attracted widespread condemnation across the West. Government and media circles present the conflict as a simple dichotomy between an evil empire and an innocent victim. In this concise, accessible, and highly informative primer, Medea Benjamin and Nicolas Davies insist the picture is more complicated. Yes, Russia's aggression was reckless and, ultimately, indefensible. But the West's reneging on promises to halt eastward expansion of NATO in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union played a major part in prompting Putin to act. So did the U.S. involvement in the 2014 Ukraine coup and Ukraine's failure to implement the Minsk peace agreements. The result is a conflict that is increasingly difficult to resolve, one that could conceivably escalate into all-out war between the United States and Russia--the world's two leading nuclear powers. Skilfully bringing together the historical record and current analysis, War in Ukraine looks at the events leading up to the conflict, surveys the different parties involved, and weighs the risks of escalation and opportunities for peace. For anyone who wants to get beneath the heavily propagandized media coverage to an understanding of a war with consequences that could prove cataclysmic, reading this timely book will be an urgent necessity. -- [page 1]||185 pages : maps ; 19 cm||947.708|BOOK - Book|[2022]||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781682193716?s=MD|

On January 28, 1742, a ramshackle vessel of patched-together wood and cloth washed up on the coast of Brazil. Inside were thirty emaciated men, barely alive, and they had an extraordinary tale to tell. They were survivors of His Majesty's Ship the Wager, a British vessel that had left England in 1740 on a secret mission during an imperial war with Spain. While the Wager had been chasing a Spanish treasure-filled galleon known as the prize of all the oceans, it had wrecked on a desolate island off the coast of Patagonia. The men, after being marooned for months and facing starvation, built the flimsy craft and sailed for more than a hundred days, traversing 2500 miles of storm-wracked seas. They were greeted as heroes. But then ... six months later, another, even more decrepit craft landed on the coast of Chile. This boat contained just three castaways, and they had a very different story to tell. The thirty sailors who landed in Brazil were not heroes--they were mutineers. The first group responded with countercharges of their own, of a tyrannical and murderous captain and his henchmen. It became clear that while stranded on the island the crew had fallen into anarchy, with warring factions fighting for dominion over the barren wilderness. As accusations of treachery and murder flew, the Admiralty convened a court martial to determine who was telling the truth. The stakes were life-and-death-for whomever the court found guilty could hang. The Wager is a grand tale of human behavior at the extremes told by one of our greatest nonfiction writers. Grann's recreation of the hidden world on a British warship rivals the work of Patrick O'Brian, his portrayal of the castaways' desperate straits stands up to the classics of survival writing such as The Endurance, and his account of the court martial has the savvy of a Scott Turow thriller. As always with Grann's work, the incredible twists of the narrative hold the reader spellbound. Most powerfully, he unearths the deeper meaning of the events, showing that it was not only the Wager's captain and crew who were on trial--it was the very idea of empire--Provided by publisher.|Maps on lining pages.|xii, 329 pages, 16 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations (some colour), maps ; 25 cm||910.916|BOOK - Book|[2023]||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780385534260?s=MD|

The War was a trauma for Israel, a dangerous superpower showdown, and, following the oil embargo, a pivotal reordering of the global economic order. The Jewish State came shockingly close to defeat. A panicky cabinet meeting debated the use of nuclear weapons. After the war, Prime Minister Golda Meir resigned in disgrace, and a 9/11-style commission investigated the debacle. But, argues Uri Kaufman, from the perspective of a half century, the War can be seen as a pivotal victory for Israel. After nearly being routed, the Israeli Defense Force clawed its way back to threaten Cairo and Damascus. In the war's aftermath both sides had to accept unwelcome truths: Israel could no longer take military superiority for granted--but the Arabs could no longer hope to wipe Israel off the map. A straight line leads from the battlefields of 1973 to the Camp David Accords of 1978 and all the treaties since. Like Michael Oren's Six Days of War, this is the definitive account of a critical moment in history--Provided by publisher.||viii, 386 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations, maps ; 25 cm||956.048|BOOK - Book|2023.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781250281883?s=MD|

And how did this economic miracle come to an end, as seems the case today? To understand the story of China's rapid rise and equally rapid fall, author Anne Stevenson-Yang takes us back to the beginning, when Deng Xiaoping took over and opened its moribund economy to Western money and know-how. Stevenson-Yang, who lived and worked in China for a quarter of a century, traces each decade of China's tumultuous development, from the roaring 1980s to today's malaise. In her first-hand account, Wild Ride, Stevenson-Yang concludes that China is returning to the poverty and isolation of the Mao era. What happened to the promise of the political change that would come with the opening of the economy? And the institutional reforms of the last four decades? The author says all that change was all an illusion. Communist China, being interested only in survival, played along and the West fell for it. With the rise of Xi Jinping, that capitalist experiment is over.

That tumultuous year saw the dramatic collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's 'pro-Western' Nationalist government, overthrown by Mao Zedong and his communist armies, and the foundation of the People's Republic of China. China 1949 follows the huge military forces that tramped across the country, the exile of once-powerful leaders and the alarm of the foreign powers watching on. The well-known figures of the Revolution are all here. But so are lesser known military and political leaders along with a host of 'ordinary' Chinese citizens and foreigners caught in the maelstrom. They include the often neglected but crucial role played by the 'Guangxi faction' within Chiang's own regime, the fate of a country woman who fled her village carrying her baby to avoid the fighting, a prominent Shanghai business man and a schoolboy from Nanyang, ordered by his teachers to trek south with his classmates in search of safety. Shadowing both the leaders and the people of China in 1949, Hutchings reveals the lived experiences, aftermath and consequences of this pivotal year -- one in which careers were made and ruined, and popular hopes for a 'new China' contrasted with fears that it would change the country forever. The legacy of 1949 still resonates today as the founding myth, source of national identity and root of the political behaviour of modern China. Graham Hutchings has written a vivid, gripping account of the year in which China abruptly changed course, and pulled the rest of world history along with it.||xxv, 306 pages : illustrations, maps ; 24 cm||951.05|BOOK - Book|2021|2021-01-28|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780755607334?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ipsyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The story begins on an international bridge between Mexico and the U.S. Miriam Rodriguez is stalking one of the men who murdered her daughter. He is a member of the Zeta drug cartel that now controls what was once Miriam's quiet hometown of San Fernando, near the U.S. border. Having dyed her hair red and wearing a disguise, Miriam single-handedly orchestrates the arrest of this man, one of the many men she has targeted and gotten arrested for the murder of her daughter, Karen. Moving back and forth in time, this deeply researched account reveals how the drug cartels built their power in Mexico; how the Zeta cartel took over the quiet town of San Fernando, with its crucial geographic location for drug smuggling, near a crossroads to the US border; and how the cartels , for money, power and control, kidnap and murder victims. Miriam's daughter, Karen, was just one of the many people disappeared by the cartels. Miriam, a brilliant and perseverant woman, begins a vigilante crusade to target Karen's killers, and then to help other victimized families seek justice. Eventually, the success of Miriam's investigation techniques and her activism on behalf of other families lead to her being murdered by the cartel. Then, her son, Luis, finds his mother's briefcase with the names of other targets and her investigation techniques, and quietly continues to pursue justice for his family and for the families of other victims of violence in Mexico--Provided by publisher.|A missing daughter, a violent cartel, and a mother's quest for vengeance--Cover.|xxxv, 339 pages : maps ; 25 cm||364.152|BOOK - Book|[2023]|2023-09-26|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593448410?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sGMn0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

A new world order, with China and India as the strongest economies, dawns. How will the West react to its new status of superpower in decline? In Kishore Mahbubani's timely polemic, he argues passionately that the West can no longer presume to impose its ideology on the world and, crucially, that it must stop seeking to intervene, politically and militarily, in the affairs of other nations,. He examines the west's greatest follies of recent times: the humiliation of Russia at the end of the Cold War, which led to the rise of Putin, and the invasion of Iraq after 9/11, which destabilized the Middle East. Yet, he argues, essential to future world peace are the Western constructs of democracy and reason, which it must continue to promote, by diplomacy rather than force, via multilateral institutions of global governance such as the UN. Only by recognizing its changing status, and seeking to influence rather than dominate, he warns, can the West continue to play a key geopolitical role. --Front flap.||105 pages : illustrations ; 21 cm||909.831|BOOK - Book|2018.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780241312865?s=MD|

Something has gone really wrong in Britain. Our economy has tanked, our freedoms are shrinking, and social divisions are growing. Our politicians seem most interested in their own careers, and much of the media only make things worse. We are living in a country almost unrecognisable from the one that existed a decade ago. But whose fault is it really? Who broke Britain and how did they do it? Bold and incisive as ever, James O'Brien reveals the shady network of influence that has created a broken Britain of strikes, shortages and scandals. He maps the web connecting dark think tanks to Downing Street, the journalists involved in selling it to the public and the media bosses pushing their own agendas.

Super-yachts, private jets and super-car collections. Blood diamonds, suspect oil deals, deforestation and murder. This is the world of Global Witness, the award-winning organisation dedicated to rooting out worldwide corruption. And this is co-founder Patrick Alley's revealing inside track on a breath-taking catalogue of modern super-crimes - and the 'shadow network' that enables them. VERY BAD PEOPLE is about following the money, going undercover in the world's most dangerous places, and bringing down the people behind the crimes. Case by case we see maverick investigators pitched against warlords, grifters and super-villains who bear every resemblance to The Night Manager's Richard Roper. One dictator's son spent $700 million in just four years on his luxury lifestyle. As they unravel crooked deals of labyrinthine complexity, the team encounter well-known corporations whose operations are no less criminal than the Mafia. This network of lawyers, bankers and real estate agents help park dirty money in London, New York, or in offshore accounts, safe from prying eyes. Patrick Alley's book is a brilliant, authoritative and fearless investigation into the darkest workings of our world - and an inspiration to all of us who want to fight back--Publisher's description.|Includes index.|xiv, 320 pages ; 24 cm||364.132|BOOK - Book|2022.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781913183486?s=MD|

These projects are vital to how we understand the world we really live in: where one nuclear missile begets one in return; where the choreography of the world's end requires massive decisions made on seconds-notice, with information that is only as good as the intelligence we have.

The very nature of international relations and its rules is changing before our eyes. For India, this means optimal relationships with all the major powers to best advance its goals. It also requires a bolder and non-reciprocal approach to the immediate and extended neighbourhood. A global footprint is now in the making that leverages India's greater capability and relevance, as well as its unique diaspora. This era of global upheaval entails greater expectations from India, putting it on the path to becoming a leading power. In The India Way, S. Jaishankar, India's Minister of External Affairs, analyses these challenges and spells out possible policy responses. In doing so, he is very conscious of balancing India's national interest with international responsibilities. He places this thinking in the context of history and tradition, appropriate for a civilizational power that seeks to reclaim its place on the world stage.|Includes index.|xiv, 226 pages ; 24 cm||327.54|BOOK - Book|[2020]||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9789353579791?s=MD|

The key question is whether or not the country can continue this growth for another 25 years. If it can, Vietnam will become a high-income country like South Korea and Taiwan, the original Tiger Economies of Asia. Engaging in conversations about Vietnam's future is challenging. Locals are often too focused on the present while foreigners are caught up in legacy and political issues of the past. Many observers also focus on the short term, a specific economic metric, or inevitably Vietnam's political system without considering the big picture or recognizing long term trends. The authors researched and analyzed a broad range of drivers to assess a possible future for Vietnam, and Vietnam - Asia's Rising Star is the result of these efforts.||xii, 278 pages : illustrations, charts ; 23 cm||959.704|BOOK - Book|2023.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9786162152009?s=MD|

McKinsey's vaunted statement of values asserts that its role is to make the world a better place, and its reputation for excellence and discretion attracts top talent from universities around the world. But what does it actually do? In When McKinsey Comes to Town, two prizewinning investigative journalists have written a portrait of the company sharply at odds with its public image. Often McKinsey's advice boils down to major cost-cutting, including layoffs and maintenance reductions, to drive up short-term profits, thereby boosting a company's stock price and the wealth of its executives who hire it, at the expense of workers and safety measures. McKinsey collects millions of dollars advising government agencies that also regulate McKinsey's corporate clients. And the firm frequently advises competitors in the same industries, but denies that this presents any conflict of interest.||x, 607 pages (large print) ; 24 cm||1.068|BOOK - Book|[2022]||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593663325?s=MD|

The book reveals just how violent and aggressive the Viet Cong were towards their own people. Fear was a weapon of choice: beheading civilians, mutilating children and destroying schools and hospitals were all legitimate tactics in the VC toolbox. The book also explains how a strategy designed to protect Vietnamese villagers made them easy targets for violent guerrillas.

The island invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa were the last two major ground campaigns to be initiated during the Pacific War. This superbly illustrated volume explores the air-sea aspects of these pivotal battles. Among the events covered are the 'death ride' of the Japanese battleship Yamato (the largest ever built), and the mass kamikaze attacks off Iwo Jima and Okinawa, as well as the amphibious invasions themselves, including the air-sea bombardment of the two islands. By early 1945, the US Navy had reached an exceptional level of coordination in its amphibious operations and was able to overrun and subdue Japanese territories efficiently. Faced with the increasing might of these forces and to prevent further defeat, Japan deployed its squadron of kamikaze and attacked many US heavy aircraft carriers and destroyers; several were sunk, while others were knocked out of the war. The book explores the devastating impact they had and considers the contribution of the USAAF and the British Pacific Fleet to the eventual victory of US air and ground forces--Amazon.ca.||96 pages : illustrations (some colour), colour maps ; 25 cm.||940.542|BOOK - Book|2022.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781472848468?s=MD|

But, with the arming of merchantmen and greater risk of damage or worse, they increasingly attacked without warning. So successful was the U-boat campaign that Churchill saw it as the gravest threat the Nation faced. The low point was the March 1943 attack on convoys SC122 and HX229 when 44 U-boats sank 22 loaded ships. The pendulum miraculously swung with improved tactics and technology. In May 1943 out of a force of over 50 U-boats that challenged ONS5, eight were sunk and 18 were damaged, some seriously. Such losses were unsustainable and, with allied yards turning out ships at ever increasing rates, Donitz withdrew his wolf packs from the North Atlantic. Expert naval author and historian Bernard Edwards traces the course of the battle of the Atlantic through a series of thrilling engagement case studies.--Publisher's description.||xiii, 200 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations ; 24 cm||940.545|BOOK - Book|2020.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781526763594?s=MD|

Even as the war drags on, Zelensky lays out his vision for its future course and, through his actions, demonstrates his strategy for countering the Russians and keeping the West on his side. The result is a riveting, up-close picture of the invasion as experienced by its number one target and improbable hero.The Showman, as a work of eyewitness journalism, provides an essential perspective on the war defining our age. As a study in leadership and human resolve, its appeal is timeless and universal.||xx, 363 pages, 16 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations (chiefly colour), maps ; 24 cm||947.708|BOOK - Book|2024.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008599171?s=MD|

Much of the existing literature on the Israel-Palestine conflict focuses on the era post-Israeli independence (starting in 1948), has a clear bias, and/or comes at the subject from an academic angle. This is a major, engagingly written trade history covering the entire arc of the conflict up to the present, and Black has done an extraordinary job of telling it from both sides., In Enemies and Neighbors, Ian Black, who has spent four decades studying and covering the Middle East, offers a major new history of the Arab-Zionist conflict from 1917 to today, published on the centenary of the Balfour Declaration and fifty years after the Six-Day War. Setting the scene in the final decades of the 19th century, when the first Zionist settlers arrived in the Ottoman-ruled Holy Land, Black draws on a wide range of sources--from declassified documents to oral testimonies to his own vivid on-the-ground reporting--to recreate major milestones in the most polarizing conflict of modern times. In the third year of World War I, the seed was planted for an inevitable clash as British troops entered Jerusalem after Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour made a fateful promise to favor the establishment of 'a national home for the Jewish people' in Palestine--without consulting its Arab majority. The story, told from both sides, proceeds through the Arab rebellion of the 1950s, the Nazi Holocaust, the war of 1948, Israel's independence and the Palestinian Nakba (catastrophe). It focuses on the watershed of 1967, followed by the Palestinian re-awakening, Israel's settlement project, two Intifadas, the Oslo Accords, and other failed peace negotiations and continued violence up to 2017. Combining engaging narrative with political analysis and social and cultural insights, Enemies and Neighbors is both an accessible overview and a fascinating investigation into the deeper truths of a furiously contested history that has preserved Palestinians and Israelis as unequal enemies and neighbors, their conflict raw and unresolved as prospects for a two-state solution have all but disappeared.--Dust jacket flaps.||xxii, 605 pages, 16 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations (some color), maps ; 24 cm||956.94|BOOK - Book|2017.|2017|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780802127037?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CT4aMQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

No dictator can rule through fear and violence alone. Naked power can be grabbed and held temporarily, but it never suffices in the long term. A tyrant who can compel his own people to acclaim him will last longer. The paradox of the modern dictator is that he must create the illusion of popular support. Throughout the twentieth century, hundreds of millions of people were condemned to enthusiasm, obliged to hail their leaders even as they were herded down the road to serfdom. In How to Be a Dictator, Frank DikoÌtter returns to eight of the most chillingly effective personality cults of the twentieth century. From carefully choreographed parades to the deliberate cultivation of a shroud of mystery through iron censorship, these dictators ceaselessly worked on their own image and encouraged the population at large to glorify them. At a time when democracy is in retreat, are we seeing a revival of the same techniques among some of today's world leaders? This timely study, told with great narrative verve, examines how a cult takes hold, grows, and sustains itself. It places the cult of personality where it belongs, at the very heart of tyranny.|First published in Great Britain as 'How to Be a Dictator', 2019--Title page verso.|274 pages : illustrations ; 20 cm||321.909|BOOK - Book|2020.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781526626998?s=MD|

In the topsy-turvy world of tax avoidance, you can get richer by buying a yacht, the world's biggest exporter of coffee is Switzerland, and billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump and the Duke of Westminster often pay less tax than you do. Written with sharp wit and over-brimming with inside secrets, the anonymous author shows us that not only does the global tax system encourage dubious practice which favours the rich, but that it was specifically founded with that in mind.

In Mao's China in the 1970s, Mercedes cars were a rarity, and only the very top government officials rode in them. During that period, my family and I lived in a government-military compound in the capital city of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang. The compound also housed some ten villas for provincial heads and generals. Of the ten top officials, only one general had a Mercedes sedan, which was given to him as a used car. Back then most Mercedes cars in China were brought from Chinese embassies in foreign countries after the ambassadors used them first. The chauffer of the general in the compound was generous in blowing the car's distinctive horn. Hearing the horn and seeing the car was a big privilege for me to brag about with my friends who did not get to live in the compound-- Provided by publisher., Leveraging its absolute power, low human rights advantage, and tolerance by other countries, the Chinese Communist Party has transformed China into a giant corporation. Living and working is not a right, but a privilege granted by the party. State-owned firms are business units or subsidiaries, private firms are joint ventures, and foreign firms are franchisees of the party. 'China, Inc.' enjoys the agility of a firm and the vast resources of a state. Meanwhile, foreign firms competing with Chinese firms can find themselves matched against the mighty Chinese state. The Rise of China, Inc. will interest many readers: it will compel business scholars to rethink state-firm relationships; assist multinational business practitioners in formulating effective strategies; aid policy-makers in countering China's expansion; and inform the public of the massive corporate organisation China has become, and how democracies can effectively deal with it. -- Publisher's description||x, 335 pages : illustrations (black and white), charts ; 24 cm||330.951|BOOK - Book|2022.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781009074926?s=MD|

A natural subject for the UK's bestselling true-crime author: a study of people who randomly kill large numbers of others (spree killers), or who set out to do so in specific places or situations (mass killers). Because of the ease of obtaining firearms in the USA, many of these, inevitably, are American, but there have been other recent examples in New Zealand and Norway. As such killings become more frequent, it is easy to blame them on the ready availability of firearms and weak or non-existent background checks, even though many countries have extremely robust firearms legislation. What is more difficult to establish, however, is the motivation behind such killings: some are occasioned by grievance, real or imagined, while others have their origins in a sense of failure or feelings of inadequacy. Other killers, however, seem to be driven by a desire for power over their fellow humans, often coupled with an overriding contempt for the lives of others. In search of answers to the questions raised, Christopher Berry-Dee offers case studies in some of the most infamous mass killings of the past fifty years, from school massacres to workplace killings, hate crimes to familicides. In doing so he demonstrates, chillingly, that such murders are almost impossible to predict, and therefore almost impossible to prevent.||xxii, 282 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations (some colour), portraits ; 20 cm||364.152|BOOK - Book|2021||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781789464221?s=MD|

Their choices are limited by mountains, rivers, seas and concrete. Yes, to understand world events you need to understand people, ideas and movements - but if you don't know geography, you'll never have the full picture. To understand Putin's actions, for example, it is essential to consider that, to be a world power, Russia must have a navy. And if its ports freeze for six months each year then it must have access to a warm water port - hence, the annexation of Crimea was the only option for Putin. To understand the Middle East, it is crucial to know that geography is the reason why countries have logically been shaped as they are - and this is why invented countries (e.g. Syria, Iraq, Libya) will not survive as nation states. Spread over ten chapters (covering Russia; China; the USA; Latin America; the Middle East; Africa; India and Pakistan; Europe; Japan and Korea; and Greenland and the Arctic), using maps, essays and occasionally the personal experiences of the widely travelled author, Prisoners of Geography looks at the past, present and future to offer an essential guide to one of the major determining factors in world history.||xv, 256 pages : maps ; 25 cm||320.12|BOOK - Book|2015.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781783961412?s=MD|

Gelvin explains how in the aftermath of the collapse of the USSR, the American invasion of Iraq, and the Arab uprisings of 2010-11, a new Middle East has emerged. Syria, Libya, and Yemen have become crisis states, where warlords vie against governments and each other. The economies of Iran, Turkey, and Lebanon, weakened by corruption, sanctions, and neoliberal economic policies, have imploded. Some states have doubled-down on repression, while others intervene in the internal affairs of their neighbors with impunity. The revised and expanded edition explores these hallmarks of the New Middle East, along with the end of American hegemony in the region, the expansion of conflict zones, the continued centrality of the Saudi-Iranian competition, and the ramifications of the breakdown of the Israel-Palestine peace process. It also highlights the crisis of human security brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, bad governance, stagnant economies, poor healthcare and educational delivery systems, climate change, food and water insecurity, population growth and imbalance, and the unprecedented displacement of populations. In a concise question-and-answer format, Gelvin outlines the social, political, and economic contours of the New Middle East, illuminating the current crisis in the region and exploring how it is likely to evolve in the decades to come-- Provided by publisher.||x, 180 pages : map ; 22 cm||320.956|BOOK - Book|2023.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780197622087?s=MD|

After hiding in a pile of timber planks for three days while 3,000 SS men and their bloodhounds searched for him, Vrba and his fellow escapee Fred Wetzler would eventually cross Nazi-occupied Poland on foot, as penniless fugitives. Their mission: to tell the world the truth of the Final Solution. Vrba would produce from memory a breathtaking report of more than thirty pages revealing the true nature and scale of Auschwitz - a report that would find its way to Roosevelt, Churchill and the Pope, eventually saving over 200,000 Jewish lives. A thrilling history with enormous historical implications, THE ESCAPE ARTIST is the extraordinary story of a complex man who would seek escape again and again: first from Auschwitz, then from his past, even from his own name. In telling his story, Jonathan Freedland - the journalist, broadcaster and acclaimed, multi-million copy selling author of the Sam Bourne novels - ensures that Rudolf Vrba's heroic mission will also escape oblivion--Publisher's description.|Paperback edition with ISBN: 9781529369069 published in 2023.|xii, 376 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations, maps ; 24 cm||940.531|BOOK - Book|2022.|2022|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781529369045?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HXebzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

J. Reuben Appelman was only six years old when the murders began and even evaded an abduction attempt during that same period, fueling a lifelong obsession with the Oakland County Child Killings. Autopsies showed that the victims had been reportedly held with care. And yet, with equal care, their bodies had been groomed postmortem, scrubbed free of evidence. There were few leads, and equally few suspects. When the abductions mysteriously stopped, a task force operating on one of the largest manhunt budgets in history shut down without an arrest. Although no more murders occurred, Detroit remained haunted. Overlaid upon the author's own history with violence, The Kill Jar tells the story of Appelman's investigation into buried leads, child pornography rings, and corruption saturating Detroit's most notorious serial killer case.--Back cover||xiii, 268 pages ; 22 cm||364.152|BOOK - Book|2019.|2019-02-26|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781501190001?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U1OIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The world's most powerful CEOs never saw it coming. In 2018, after a decade-long bull market, the CEO of American Airlines declared, I don't think we're ever going to lose money again. The U.S. entered March 2020 riding an eleven-year economic high, with unemployment at record lows, the Dow Jones flirting with 30,000, and the good times certain to continue. By the end of the month, ten million people were out of work, iconic firms were begging for bailouts, and countless small businesses were in freefall. Slick consulting teams and country-club connections were suddenly of little use: CEOs were fumbling in the dark, tossing out long-term strategy and making decisions on the fly that, they hoped, might just save them. In Crash Landing, Liz Hoffman shows how the pandemic set the economy on fire-but if you look closely, the tinder was already there. After 2008, corporate leaders had embraced cheap debt and growth at all costs. Wages went stagnant. Millions were pushed into the gig economy. Companies crammed workers into offices, and airlines did the same with planes. Wall Street cheered on this relentless march toward efficiency, overlooking its collateral damage. Based on access to an astonishing array of business titans, Crash Landing is Liz Hoffman's account of the most remarkable year in modern economic history. She takes readers into the beating heart of the twenty-first-century economy, revealing how the pandemic exposed its pressure points. Bankruptcies decimate retail. Banking and pharma rivals team up. Bleeding cash, airlines like Delta weigh safety against survival. An untested White House fumbles for the 2008 playbook. There's Goldman Sachs's David Solomon blindsided by a virus in the middle of a high-stakes reinvention; American Airlines's Doug Parker, shuttling between K Street and the White House, determined to secure a multi-billion-dollar bailout; and Ford's Jim Hackett, gambling on the switch from cars to ventilators. In Crash Landing, Hoffman probes the pandemic's implications for the future of work, corporate leadership, and capitalism itself, asking: Will this remarkable time give rise to newfound resilience, or become just another costly mistake to be forgotten?--Provided by publisher.||xxi, 275 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates : colour illustrations ; 25 cm||330.973|BOOK - Book|[2023]|2023-03-07|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593239018?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CS2OEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Fourth turning.||The visionary behind the bestselling phenomenon The Fourth Turning looks once again to America's past to predict our future in this startling and hopeful prophecy for how our present era of civil unrest will resolve over the next ten years--and what our lives will look like once it has-- Provided by publisher., Twenty-five years ago, Neil Howe and the late William Strauss dazzled the world with a provocative new theory of American history. Looking back at the last 500 years, they'd uncovered a distinct pattern: modern history moves in cycles, each one lasting roughly eighty to one hundred years, the length of a long human life, with each cycle composed of four eras--or turnings--that always arrive in the same order and each last about twenty years. The last of these eras--the fourth turning--was always the most perilous, a period of civic upheaval and national mobilization as traumatic and transformative as the New Deal and World War II, the Civil War, or the American Revolution. Now, right on schedule, our own fourth turning has arrived. And so Neil Howe has returned with an extraordinary new prediction. What we see all around us--the polarization, the growing threat of civil conflict and global war--will culminate by the early 2030s in a climax that poses great danger and yet also holds great promise, perhaps even bringing on America's next golden age. Every generation alive today will play a vital role in determining how this crisis is resolved, for good or ill.|Original work The Fourth Turning written by William Strauss and Neil Howe in 1997.|xi, 578 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm||303.497|BOOK - Book|2023.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781982173739?s=MD|

This book expertly examines the history of a people and a nation with ancient roots which only took its current shape in the 19th century under French colonial rule, and its current name in 1945.  Before that, Vietnam was known by many names, under many rulers. Located in the geographic center of Southeast Asia, the country we call Vietnam was ruled by China, then by a series of Vietnamese emperors, and by the French. A devastating, decades-long conflict for independence ensued, ending with the conclusion of the Vietnam War in 1975. Key topics discussed in this fascinating book include: China's ancient conquest of Vietnam and the millennia-long struggle of the Vietnamese for independence from their powerful neighbor to the north The reign of the Nguyen dynasty, the last dynasty to rule Vietnam, with its capital at the ancient city of Hue, today a UNESCO World Heritage Site The story of Ho Chi Minh, educated in France, who attended the Treaty of Versailles to advocate for independence and became Vietnam's first president after the French were defeated The country's miraculous emergence from three decades of war and how it has embarked on the path to becoming one of the world's fastest-growing economies today  Journalist Bill Hayton's accessible prose makes A Brief History of Vietnam an essential study of a complex culture at the heart of Southeast Asia--and the roots of its current economic dynamism--Prvoded by publisher.||288 pages, 32 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations (chiefly colour), maps ; 21 cm||959.7|BOOK - Book|[2022]||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780804854184?s=MD|

The devastating attack claims the lives of over 2,400 American soldiers, sinks or damages eighteen ships, and destroys nearly 350 aircraft. The US Congress declares war on Japan the following day. In this vivid and lively book, Takuma Melber breathes new life into the dramatic events that unfolded before, during, and after Pearl Harbor by putting the perspective of the Japanese attackers at the center. Most other histories of Pearl Harbor are told from the American point of view, so by giving attention to the Japanese perspective as well, Melber is able to provide a richer, more comprehensive and more balanced account of the battle, its conditions, and its consequences. He sheds new light on the long negotiations that went on between the Japanese and Americans in 1941, and shows how US intelligence and military leaders in Washington misinterpreted the information they had about Japanese war intentions. Melber's description of the battle itself is informed by the latest research and benefits from including the plannng and post-raid assessment made by the Japanese commanders. This balanced and thorougly researched book deepens our understanding of the battle that precipitated America's entry into the war and will appeal to anyone interested in World War II and military history--Back cover.|Originally published in German as Pearl Harbor: Japans Angriff und der Kriegseintritt der USA by Takuma Melber Â© Verlag C.H.

When apartheid in South Africa ended in 1994, dismantled by internal activism and global pressure, why did Israel continue to pursue its own apartheid policies against Palestinians? In keeping with a history of antagonism, the Israeli state accelerated the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Territories as extreme right-wing voices gained prominence in government, with comparatively little international backlash. Condensing this complex history into a lucid essay, Raja Shehadeh examines the many lost opportunities to promote a lasting peace and equality between Israelis and Palestinians. Since the creation of Israel in 1948, known to Palestinians as the Nakba, or catastrophe, each side's perception of events has strongly diverged. What can this discrepancy tell us about Israel's undermining of a two-state solution? And will the current genocide in Gaza finally mark a shift in the world's response? With graceful, haunting prose, Shehadeh offers insights into a defining conflict that could yet be resolved.|This essay is based on a lecture given at SOAS, University of London, and Kyoto University, in 2017, and has been revised and extended in 2024.--Title page verso.|113 pages : map ; 19 cm||956.942|BOOK - Book|[2024]||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781635425352?s=MD|

There would be only two battleship vs battleship actions in the Pacific in World War II, both of which are assessed in this study. At Guadalcanal in 1942, Kirishima faced two modern US battleships, Washington and South Dakota. In the Surigao Strait in 1944, two World War I-era Japanese battleships, Yamashiro and Fuso, faced six American battleships supported by four heavy cruisers in history's last ever class between battleships. Employing full-color artwork, carefully selected archive photographs, and expert analysis, Mark Stille examines the two head-to-head classes between the battleships deployed by the United States and Japan in the struggle for victory in the Pacific during World War II.--Page [4] of cover.||80 pages : illustrations (some color), color maps, portraits ; 25 cm.||940.542|BOOK - Book|2017.|2017-11-21|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781472817198?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PKomEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

His account is the first to be based on hundreds of previously unseen archival documents, from the secret minutes of top party meetings to confidential bank reports. This chronicle recasts our understanding of an era that both the regime and foreign admirers celebrate as an economic miracle. In charting four decades of so-called 'Reform and Opening Up' and China's emergence as a world power, DikoÌtter tells a fascinating tale of contradictions and illusions, of shadow banking, anti-corruption drives and extreme state wealth standing alongside everyday poverty. He examines China's approach to the 2008 financial crash, the country's increasing hostility towards perceived Western interference and its development into a thoroughly entrenched dictatorship - one equipped with a sprawling security apparatus and the most sophisticated surveillance system in the world. Ultimately, the book concludes, the communist party's goal was never to join the democratic sphere, but to resist it - and then defeat it--Publisher's description.||xvi, 390 pages, 16 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations, map ; 24 cm||951.057|BOOK - Book|2022.|2022-09-29|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781526634283?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ANuPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

When Biggio showed the gun to his neighbor, WWII veteran Corporal Joseph Drago, it unlocked memories Drago had kept unspoken for 50 years.  On the spur of the moment, Biggio asked Drago to sign the rifle. Thus began this Marine's mission to find as many WWII veterans as he could, get their signatures on the rifle, and document their stories. For two years, Biggio traveled across the country to interview America's last-living WWII veterans.  Each time he put the M1 Garand Rifle in their hands, their eyes lit up with memories triggered by holding the weapon that had been with them every step of the war. With each visit and every story told to Biggio, the veterans signed their names to the rifle. 96 signatures now cover that rifle, each a reminder of the price of war and the courage of our soldiers--From publisher's website.||295 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm||940.548|BOOK - Book|[2021]|2021-06|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781684510795?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0bsyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

I pack my bags, talk to the survivors, write my stories, then go home to wait for the next catastrophe. I don't wait very long.' Journalist Patricia Evangelista came of age in the aftermath of a street revolution that forged a new future for the Philippines. Three decades later, in the face of mounting inequality, the nation discovered the fragility of its democratic institutions under the regime of strongman Rodrigo Duterte. Some People Need Killing is Evangelista's meticulously reported and deeply human chronicle of the Philippines' drug war and Duterte's assault on the country's struggling democracy. For six years, Evangelista had the distinctive beat of chronicling the killings carried out by police and vigilantes in the name of Duterte's war on drugs - a war that has led to the slaughter of thousands - immersing herself in the world of killers and survivors and capturing the atmosphere of fear created when an elected president decides that some lives are worth less than others--Provided by publisher.||xvi, 428 pages ; 25 cm||364.134|BOOK - Book|[2023]|2023-10-17|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593133132?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7oq2EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Essential reading for anyone who wants to understand this rising superpower on the verge of what promises to be the 'Chinese century'., This lavishly illustrated volume explores the history of China during a period of dramatic shifts and surprising transformations, from the founding of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) through to the present day. The Oxford Illustrated History of Modern China promises to be essential reading for anyone who wants to understand this rising superpower on the verge of what promises to be the 'Chinese century,' introducing readers to important but often overlooked events in China's past, such as the bloody Taiping Civil War (1850-1864), which had a death toll far higher than the roughly contemporaneous American Civil War. It also helps readers see more familiar landmarks in Chinese history in new ways, such as the Opium War (1839-1842), the Boxer Uprising of 1900, the rise to power of the Chinese Communist Party in 1949, and the Tiananmen protests and Beijing Massacre of 1989. This is one of the first major efforts - and in many ways the most ambitious to date - to come to terms with the broad sweep of modern Chinese history, taking readers from the origins of modern China right up through the dramatic events of the last few years (the Beijing Games, the financial crisis, and China's rise to global economic pre-eminence) which have so fundamentally altered Western views of China and China's place in the world. -- Publisher's description||xi, 361 pages : illustrations (some color), color maps ; 26 cm||951.03|BOOK - Book|2016.|2016|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780199683758?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BRs9DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Killer in the Kremlin  traces Putin's bloody career... a life littered with corpses.' -   THE TIMES    A gripping and explosive account of Vladimir Putin's tyranny, charting his rise from spy to tsar,   exposing the events that led to his invasion of Ukraine and his assault on Europe.  In  Killer in the Kremlin , award-winning journalist John Sweeney takes readers from the heart of Putin's Russia to the killing fields of Chechnya, to the embattled cities of an invaded Ukraine. In a disturbing exposeÌ of Putin's sinister ambition, Sweeney draws on thirty years of his own reporting - from the Moscow apartment bombings to the atrocities committed by the Russian Army in Chechnya, to the annexation of Crimea and a confrontation with Putin over the shooting down of flight MH17 - to understand the true extent of Putin's long war. Drawing on eyewitness accounts and compelling testimony from those who have suffered at Putin's hand, we see the heroism of the Russian opposition, the bravery of the Ukrainian resistance, and the brutality with which the Kremlin responds to such acts of defiance, assassinating or locking away its critics, and stopping at nothing to achieve its imperialist aims. In the midst of one of the darkest acts of aggression in modern history - Russia's invasion of Ukraine - this book shines a light on Putin's rule and poses urgent questions about how the world must respond.

Naval Intelligence intercepted the itinerary of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, whose stealth attack on Pearl Harbor precipitated America's entry into the war. On April 18th he would travel to Rabaul in the South Pacific to visit Japanese troops, then fly to the Japanese airfield at Balalale, 400 miles to the southeast. Operation Vengeance was born. To avoid detection, U.S. pilots had to embark on a circuitous, 1,000-mile odyssey that would test not only their skills but the physical integrity of their planes. The slightest miscalculation, even by a few minutes, meant the entire plan would collapse.

He has the power to reduce the West to nuclear ashes. He invades his neighbours, meddles in western elections and orders assassinations. His regime is autocratic and corrupt. Yet many Russians continue to support him. Under Putin's leadership, Russia has once again become a force to be reckoned with. Philip Short's magisterial biography explores in unprecedented depth the personality of Russia's leader and demolishes many of our preconceptions about Putin's Russia. To explain is not to justify. Putin's regime is dark. But on closer examination, much of what we think we know about him turns out to rest on half-truths. This book is as close as we will come to understanding Russia's ruler.

But this is not where power actually resides. From the 1990s onwards, globalization has shattered the map, leading to an explosion of new legal entities: tax havens, free ports, city-states, gated enclaves and special economic zones. These new spaces are freed from ordinary forms of regulation, taxation and mutual obligation - and with them, ultracapitalists believe that it is possible to escape the bonds of democratic government and oversight altogether. Historian Quinn Slobodian follows the most notorious radical libertarians - from Milton Friedman to Peter Thiel - around the globe as they search for the perfect home for their free market fantasy. The hunt leads from Hong Kong in the 1970s to South Africa in the late days of apartheid, from the neo-Confederate South to the medieval City of London, and finally into the world's oceans and war zones, charting the relentless quest for a blank slate where capitalism and democracy can be finally uncoupled. Crack-Up Capitalism is a propulsive history of the recent past, and an alarming view of our near future||pages ; cm||330.122|BOOK - Book|2024.|2024-04-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780141993768?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nN4M0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The gulf between Islam and the West is widening. A faith rich with strong values and traditions, observed by nearly two billion people across the world, is seen by the West as something to be feared rather than understood. Sensational headlines and hardline policies spark enmity, while ignoring the feelings, narratives and perceptions that preoccupy Muslims today. Wise and authoritative, The House of Islam seeks to provide entry to the minds and hearts of Muslims the world over. It introduces us to the fairness, kindness and mercy of Mohamed; the aims of sharia law, through commentary on scripture, to provide an ethical basis to life; the beauty of Islamic art and the permeation of the divine in public spaces; and the tension between mysticism and literalism that still threatens the House of Islam. The decline of the Muslim world and the current crises of leadership mean that a glorious past, full of intellectual nobility and purpose, is now exploited by extremists and channeled into acts of terror. How can Muslims confront the issues that are destroying Islam from within, and what can the West do to help work towards that end? Ed Husain expertly and compassionately guides us through the nuances of Islam and its people, contending that the Muslim world need not be a stranger to the West, nor its enemy, but a peaceable ally.--Jacket.||x, 320 pages ; 25 cm||297.0|BOOK - Book|2018.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781408872260?s=MD|

It is also misunderstood, misquoted, and fiercely debated.  If, as Chrisitans believe, the Bible is the word of God, why is it so complex and difficult to interpret in parts, yet simple enough for even children to understand in others?  In Scripture and the Skeptic, Eric Huffman, author of 40 Days of Doubt, helps readers understand and cope with confusion about the Bible and provides answers to questions by reframing it as a perfect and seamless story.  Huffman illustrates how the Bible, even the parts come consider ungodly, presents the perfect love story that God intended to tell.-- Back cover.|Includes Resources for personal reflection and group discussion (pages 203-215).|224 pages ; 18 cm||239.0|BOOK - Book|[2021]|2020-09|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781791004217?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SM5fzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

D-Day was the greatest invasion in history. An epic battle that involved 156,000 men, 7,000 ships and 20,000 armoured vehicles, the desperate struggle that unfolded on 6 June was, above all, a story of individual heroics - men who were driven to keep fighting, until the German defences were smashed and the precarious beachheads secured. In D-DAY Giles Milton paints a dazzling canvas of the opening day of battle, exploring the momentous events through the prism of those who took part. Sweeping from the principal architects at Supreme Command to the graphic testimonies of the men who struggled ashore on the morning of 6 June, his narrative lays bare the absolute terror of those on both sides trapped in the frontline massacres of Operation Overlord. In an overview that is both meticulous and vast, 'the longest day' is revealed as never before - less a masterpiece of strategic planning than a day on which thousands of scared young men found themselves staring death in the face - told through the eyes of those who took part, as we approach the 75th anniversary of the battle in 2019.||xiv, 486 pages : illustrations, maps ; 25 cm||940.542|BOOK - Book|2018.|2018-09-20|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781473649026?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_Dd_swEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Rommel was a man of contradictions, a soldier who wrote a bestselling book about World War I, a commander who went from commanding Hitler's bodyguard to trying to kill him, a serious military mind who was known for participating in practical jokes.

From economic development to health care to education and public policy, we rely on numbers to allocate resources and make crucial decisions. But because so much data fails to take into account gender, because it treats men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. And women pay tremendous costs for this bias, in time, money, and often with their lives. Celebrated feminist advocate Caroline Criado Perez investigates this shocking root cause of gender inequality in Invisible Women. Examining the home, the workplace, the public square, the doctor's office, and more, Criado Perez unearths a dangerous pattern in data and its consequences on women's lives. Product designers use a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to everything from pianos to cell phones to voice recognition software, when in fact this approach is designed to fit men. Cities prioritize men's needs when designing public transportation, roads, and even snow removal, neglecting to consider women's safety or unique responsibilities and travel patterns. And in medical research, women have largely been excluded from studies and textbooks, leaving them chronically misunderstood, mistreated., and misdiagnosed. Built on hundreds of studies in the US, the UK, and around the world, and written with energy, wit, and sparkling intelligence, this is a groundbreaking, highly readable exposeÌ that will change the way you look at the world--Dust jacket.||xv, 411 pages ; 24 cm||305.42|BOOK - Book|[2019]|2019-03-12|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781419729072?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RX5EugEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The American people were still sick with COVID-19, his economists were already warning him of an imminent financial crisis, and his party, the Democrats, had the barest of majorities in the Senate. Yet, faced with an unprecedented set of crises, Joe Biden decided he would not play defense. Instead, he set out to transform the nation. He proposed the most ambitious domestic spending bills since the 1960s and vowed to withdraw American forces from Afghanistan, ending the nation's longest war and reorienting it toward a looming competition with China. With unparalleled access to the tight inner circle of advisers who have surrounded Biden for decades, Franklin Foer dramatizes in forensic detail the first two years of the Biden presidency, concluding with the historic midterm elections. The result is a gripping and high-definition portrait of a major president at a time when democracy itself seems imperiled. With his back to the wall, Biden resorted to old-fashioned politics: deal-making and compromise. It was a gamble that seemed at first disastrously anachronistic, as he struggled to rally even the support of his own party. Yet, as the midterms drew near, via a series of bills with banal names, Biden somehow found a way to invest trillions of dollars in clean energy, the domestic semiconductor industry, and new infrastructure. Had he done the impossible-breaking decisively with the old Washington consensus to achieve progressive goals?  The Last Politician is a landmark work of political reporting-which includes thrilling, blow-by-blow insider reports of the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan and the White House's swift response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine-that is destined to shape history's view of a president in the eye of the storm--Provided by publisher.||414 pages ; 25 cm||973.934|BOOK - Book|[2023]|2023-09-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781101981146?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BI26EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

But having trained for fifteen years in the Eagle, it wasn't Eastern Bloc-operated MiGs that the F-15 eventually came up against, but pilots of Saddam Hussein's Iraqi air force. This book analyzes the combat between the American and Soviet Cold War fighters in a balanced and objective fashion, examining how the technical abilities of the aircraft combined with the different levels of training available to opposing pilots and ground crews allowed the F-15s to destroy the Iraqi offensive abilities within weeks of the start of the First Gulf War.

A year later, he was unknowingly assigned to the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, a group of airmen whose mission was to sacrifice their lives by crashing planes into enemy ships. Their callsign was ten dead, zero alive. WWII and his eventual life as a kendo instructor, police officer and detective. His attention to detail, unwavering self-discipline and impenetrably strong mind were often the difference between life and death. Odachi, who is now well into his nineties, kept his Kamikaze past a secret for most of his life. Seven decades later, he agreed to sit for nearly seventy hours of interviews with the authors of this book, who know Odachi personally. He felt it was his responsibility to finally reveal the truth about the Kamikaze pilots: that they were unsuspecting teenagers and young men asked to do the bidding of superior officers who were never held to account.This book offers a new perspective on these infamous suicide pilots. It is not a chronicle of war, nor is it a collection of research papers compiled by scholars.

In the winter trenches and flak-filled skies of World War I, soldiers and pilots might avoid death, only to find themselves imprisoned in Germany's archipelago of prison camps, often in abominable conditions. The most infamous was Holzminden, a land-locked Alcatraz that housed the most troublesome, escape-prone officers. Its commandant was a boorish, hate-filled tyrant named Karl Niemeyer who swore that none should ever leave.  Desperate to break out of Hellminden and return to the fight, a group of Allied prisoners led by ace pilot (and former Army sapper) David Gray hatch an elaborate escape plan. Their plot demands a risky feat of engineering as well as a bevy of disguises, forged documents, fake walls, and steely resolve. Once beyond the watchtowers and round-the-clock patrols, Gray and almost a dozen of his half-starved fellow prisoners must then make a heroic 150-mile dash through enemy-occupied territory toward free Holland. Drawing on never-before-seen memoirs and letters, Neal Bascomb brings this narrative to cinematic life, amid the twilight of the British Empire and the darkest, most savage hours of the fight against Germany.

E.|Charles Goodhart, Manoj Pradhan|Globalization Economic aspects., Population aging Economic aspects., Age distribution (Demography), Economic policy., Economics., International finance., Labor economics., Macroeconomics., Social policy., Pradhan, Manoj Vasant, author.|Business & Economics|This original and panoramic book proposes that the underlying forces of demography and globalisation will shortly reverse three multi-decade global trends - it will raise inflation and interest rates, but lead to a pullback in inequality. Whatever the future holds, the authors argue, it will be nothing like the past. Deflationary headwinds over the last three decades have been primarily due to an enormous surge in the worlds available labour supply, owing to very favourable demographic trends and the entry of China and Eastern Europe into the worlds trading system. This book demonstrates how these demographic trends are on the point of reversing sharply, coinciding with a retreat from globalisation. The result? Ageing can be expected to raise inflation and interest rates, bringing a slew of problems for an over-indebted world economy, but is also anticipated to increase the share of labour, so that inequality falls. Covering many social and political factors, as well as those that are more purely macroeconomic, the authors address topics including ageing, dementia, inequality, populism, retirement and debt finance, among others. This book will be of interest and understandable to anyone with an interest on where the worlds economy is going.||xx, 260 pages : illustrations (black and white, and color) ; 24 cm||304.62|BOOK - Book|[2020]|2020-08-09|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9783030426569?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8ilNzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Was there an illegal immigrant who couldn't be deported because he had a pet cat? Are unelected judges truly enemies of the people? Most of us think the law is only relevant to criminals, if we even think of it at all. But the law touches every area of our lives: from intimate family matters to the biggest issues in our society. Our unfamiliarity is dangerous because it makes us vulnerable to media spin, political lies and the kind of misinformation that frequently comes from loud-mouthed amateurs and those with vested interests. This 'fake law' allows the powerful and the ignorant to corrupt justice without our knowledge - worse, we risk letting them make us complicit. Thankfully, the Secret Barrister is back to reveal the stupidity, malice and incompetence behind many of the biggest legal stories of recent years. In Fake Law, the Secret Barrister debunks the lies and builds a defence against the abuse of our law, our rights and our democracy that is as entertaining as it is vital.||386 pages ; 24 cm||364.941|BOOK - Book|2020.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781529009941?s=MD|

In this important and illuminating book, Bassam Tibi, a senior scholar of Islamic politics, provides a corrective to this dangerous gap in our understanding. He explores the true nature of contemporary Islamism and the essential ways in which it differs from the religious faith of Islam. Drawing on research in twenty Islamic countries over three decades, Tibi describes Islamism as a political ideology based on a reinvented version of Islamic law. In separate chapters devoted to the major features of Islamism, he discusses the Islamist vision of state order, the centrality of antisemitism in Islamist ideology, Islamism's incompatibility with democracy, the reinvention of jihadism as terrorism, the invented tradition of shari'a law as constitutional order, and the Islamists' confusion of the concepts of authenticity and cultural purity. Tibi's concluding chapter applies elements of Hannah Arendt's theory to identify Islamism as a totalitarian ideology.||xx, 340 pages ; 25 cm||320.557|BOOK - Book|2012.|2012-05-22|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780300159981?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KH2qpnCBGwkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Victory, on 12 July 1943, at Prokhorovka over Hitler's vaunted SS troops has traditionally been described as a turning point in the Second World War.

In this unique book, Peter Vronsky documents the psychological, investigative, and cultural aspects of serial murder, beginning with its first recorded instance in Ancient Rome, through fifteenth-century France, up to such notorious contemporary cases as cannibal/necrophile Ed Kemper, Henry Lee Lucas, Ted Bundy, and the emergence of what he classifies as the serial rampage killer such as Andrew Cunanan. Vronsky not only offers sound theories on what makes a serial killer, but also provides concrete suggestions on how to survive an encounter with one-from recognizing verbal warning signs to physical confrontational resistance. Exhaustively researched with transcripts of interviews with killers, and featuring up-to-date information on the apprehension and conviction of the Green River Killer and the Beltway Snipers, Vronsky's one-of-a-kind book covers every conceivable aspect of an endlessly riveting true-crime phenomenon.||xx, 412 pages, 16 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations ; 23 cm||364.152|BOOK - Book|2004.|2004-10-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780425196403?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nVtdAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

On a shoestring budget and with little support, Pedersen picked eight of the finest pilots to help train a new generation to bend jets like the F-4 Phantom to their will and learn how to dogfight all over again. What resulted was nothing short of a revolution -- one that took young American pilots from the crucible of combat training in the California desert to the blistering skies of Vietnam, in the process raising America's Navy combat kill ratio from two enemy planes downed for every American plane lost to more than 22 to 1. Topgun emerged not only as an icon of America's military dominance immortalized by Hollywood but as a vital institution that would shape the nation's military strategy for generations to come. Pedersen takes readers on a colorful and thrilling ride-from Miramar to Area 51 to the decks of aircraft carriers in war and peace-through a historic moment in air warfare. He helped establish a legacy that was built by him and his Original Eight - the best of the best - and carried on for six decades by some of America's greatest leaders. Topgun is a heartfelt and personal testimonial to patriotism, sacrifice, and American innovation and daring.|Includes index., The real story.--Cover.|xiv, 304 pages, 16 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations, portraits ; 20 cm.||358.435|BOOK - Book|2019.|2022-05-12|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781405943826?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZI4sxQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Banks drowning in bad loans. An urban landscape littered with ghost towns of empty property. Industrial zones stalked by zombie firms. Trade tariffs blocking the path to global markets. And yet, against the odds and against expectations, growth continues, wealth rises, international influence expands. The coming collapse of China is always coming, never arriving. Thomas Orlik, a veteran of more than a decade in Beijing, turns the spotlight on China's fragile fundamentals, and resources for resilience. Drawing on discussions with Communist cadres, shadow bankers, and migrant workers, Orlik pieces together a unique perspective on China's past, present, and possible futures.--From publisher's description.||xii, 228 pages : charts ; 24 cm||330.951|BOOK - Book|2020.|2020|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780190877408?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_47UDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It has become conventional wisdom that America and China are running a superpower marathon that may last a century. Yet Hal Brands and Michael Beckley pose a counterintuitive question: What if the sharpest phase of that competition is more like a decade-long sprint? The Sino-American contest is driven by clashing geopolitical interests and a stark ideological dispute over whether authoritarianism or democracy will dominate the 21st century. But both history and China's current trajectory suggest that this rivalry will reach its moment of maximum danger in the 2020s. China is at a perilous moment: strong enough to violently challenge the existing order, yet losing confidence that time is on its side. Numerous examples from antiquity to the present show that rising powers become most aggressive when their fortunes fade, their difficulties multiply, and they realize they must achieve their ambitions now or miss the chance to do so forever. China has already started down this path. Witness its aggression toward Taiwan, its record-breaking military buildup, and its efforts to dominate the critical technologies that will shape the world's future. Over the long run, the Chinese challenge will most likely prove more manageable than many pessimists currently believe-but during the 2020s, the pace of Sino-American conflict will accelerate, and the prospect of war will be frighteningly real. America, Brands and Beckley argue, will still need a sustainable approach to winning a protracted global competition. But first, it needs a near-term strategy for navigating the danger zone ahead--Provided by publisher.||xix, 275 pages ; 24 cm||327.73|BOOK - Book|[2022]|2022-08-23|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781324021308?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X2uPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Few non-specialists appreciate how oil traders approach the markets, what their backgrounds are, and how they make money. This book brings the oil trading world to vivid life by introducing the reader to 40 real-life trades or strategies that were carried out by named market participants. The 40 chapters cover different geographies and different crude oil markets, providing an unparalleled insight into how crude oil traders work and think. Oil trading developed in its current form in the 1980s and the chapters cover these early beginnings through to the present day. The trades have been grouped in sections that relate to the nature of each trade and its broader use as an example of a successful trading style. Sections cover approaches to arbitrage trading; the impact of geopolitics; logistics and storage plays; short-term versus longer term trading; managing new crude oil grades; trading crude oil derivatives. The book provides plenty of inspiration for current or prospective crude oil traders or analysts. It will also be valuable for academic researchers, business school case studies, and for anyone wanting to learn more about the individuals that shape the world's most important commodity market-- Provided by publisher.||1 volume ; 24 cm.||332.632|BOOK - Book|2022.|2022|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780367700409?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IJeazgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Are economic crises inevitable under capitalism? Is government intervention in an economy a helpful approach or a disastrous idea? The answers to such basic economic questions matter to everyone, yet the unfamiliar jargon and math of economics can seem daunting. This clear, accessible, and even humorous book is ideal for young readers new to economics and for all readers who seek a better understanding of the full sweep of economic history and ideas. Economic historian Niall Kishtainy organizes short, chronological chapters that center on big ideas and events. He recounts the contributions of key thinkers including Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, John Maynard Keynes, and others, while examining topics ranging from the invention of money and the rise of agrarianism to the Great Depression, entrepreneurship, environmental destruction, inequality, and behavioral economics. The result is a uniquely enjoyable volume that succeeds in illuminating the economic ideas and forces that shape our world.|Includes index.|vi, 249 pages : illustrations ; 23 cm||330.09|BOOK - Book|[2017]||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780300206364?s=MD|

Developed in the 1970s as a match for the American F-15 Eagle, the aircraft remains one of the most important fighters in the current Russian arsenal, and has formed the basis for many variants including the Su-30, Su-34, and Su-35. Though larger than Russia's famed MiG-29, it is extremely maneuverable and considerably more powerful. The Su-27 can also fly at extremely high angles of attack--an ability it is fond of demonstrating at airshows, along with its legendary Cobra maneuver. The Su-27 remains in production, and nearly a dozen countries--including China, India, and Vietnam--currently operate this high-performance aircraft. The book is superbly illustrated with more than 210 color images, and includes more than thirty color aircraft profiles displaying color schemes--Page [4] of color.||224 pages : color illustrations ; 29 cm||623.746|BOOK - Book|[2018]|2018-11-28|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780764356377?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9ApctAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

No Hollywood scriptwriter could possibly have envisioned the breathless, adrenaline-pumping climax to the 2021 Formula 1 season. On the very last lap of the final race of an unbelievably arduous and controversial season, Red Bull's Max Verstappen nervelessly overtook the seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes to clinch the first place that thrust the young prodigy to the narrowest of victories and to his first World Drivers' title. He followed up by taking the 2022 title as well. Verstappen may only be 25 years of age, but the Dutch motorsport sensation has an incredible record in F1: 163 race starts, 77 podium finishes and 35 Grand Prix victories barely tell the story - this young man has already left an indelible mark on the sport. The son of F1 driver Jos, Verstappen junior quickly stepped out of his father's shadow: his youthful charisma, ferocious speed, fearless driving style and refusal to back down mark him out as a true champion. And the phenomenal success of Netflix's Drive to Survive documentary series has elevated his worldwide popularity still further. Widely respected motorsport writer and F1 insider Mark Hughes is perfectly placed to write the most authoritative narrative on Verstappen's incredible rise through the ranks to F1 glory. Hughes' immaculate credentials and first-rate access enable him to generate fresh and fascinating insights, and to paint a fully-rounded and richly-textured portrait of one of the most exciting young sportsmen on the planet.|Includes index.|344 pages ; 24 cm||796.72|BOOK - Book|2023.|2023-09-07|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781472299086?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YbBvzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

First appearing as an online series, the column quickly attracted millions of readers through its accessible examination of universal topics like the nature of science, consciousness and morality, while also probing more contemporary issues such as the morality of drones, gun control and the gender divide. Now collected for the first time in this handsomely designed volume, The Stone Reader presents 133 meaningful and influential essays from the series, placing nearly the entirety of modern philosophical discourse at a reader's grasp. The book, divided into four broad sections--Philosophy, Science, Religion and Morals, and Society--opens with a series of questions about the scope, history and identity of philosophy: What are the practical uses of philosophy? Does the discipline, begun in the West in ancient Greece with Socrates, favor men and exclude women? Does the history and study of philosophy betray a racial bias against non-white thinkers, or geographical bias toward the West? These questions and others form a foundation for readers as the book moves to the second section, Science, where some of our most urgent contemporary philosophical debates are taking place. Will artificial intelligence compromise our morality? Does neuroscience undermine our free will? Is there is a legitimate place for the humanities in a world where science and technology appear to rule? Should the evidence for global warming change the way we live, or die? In the book's third section, Religion and Morals, we find philosophy where it is often at its best, sharpest and most disturbing--working through the arguments provoked by competing moral theories in the face of real-life issues and rigorously addressing familiar ethical dilemmas in a new light. Can we have a true moral life without belief in God? What are the dangers of moral relativism? In its final part, Society, The Stone Reader returns to its origins as a forum to encourage philosophers who are willing to engage closely, critically and analytically with the affairs of the day, including economic inequality, technology and racial discrimination. In directly confronting events like the September 11 attacks, the killing of Trayvon Martin, the Sandy Hook School massacre, the essays here reveal the power of philosophy to help shape our viewpoints on nearly every issue we face today. With an introduction by Peter Catapano that details the column's founding and distinct editorial process at The New York Times, and prefatory notes to each section by Simon Critchley, The Stone Reader promises to become not only an intellectual landmark but also a confirmation that philosophy is, indeed, for everyone.||xxviii, 794 pages ; 24 cm||190.0|BOOK - Book|2022.|2022-02-08|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781324091493?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u2yPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Raised amid poverty in a riverside slum and with a background in the furniture export trade, Jokowi broke the mould for political leaders in the world's third-largest democracy. His meteoric rise came without the benefit of personal connections to the traditional elites who have dominated Indonesian politics for three-quarters of a century, making this a true 'rags to riches' story. This new official biography tells the story of how the boy from the riverbank made it to the presidential palace in record time. Readers will learn how his personal background and heritage have created a distinctive style of politics and informed his ambitious development goals - including massive infrastructure projects, universal healthcare and a reimagining of Indonesia's educational system. It also looks at how a man raised with a traditionally Javanese worldview negotiates the tensions, contradictions and conflicts of this vast archipelagic nation. Written by a political insider with unparalleled access to the president and an intimate first-hand knowledge of his decision-making processes, this book is essential reading for anyone looking to understand the political present - and the future - of Southeast Asia's largest nation.||288 pages, 64 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations (some color), portraits (color), maps ; 24 cm.||959.804|BOOK - Book|[2021]|2021-08|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780804854177?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=s-UjzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The son of two KGB agents and the product of the best Soviet institutions, the savvy, sophisticated Gordievsky grew to see his nation's communism as both criminal and philistine. He took his first posting for Russian intelligence in 1968 and eventually became the Soviet Union's top man in London, but from 1973 on he was secretly working for MI6. For nearly a decade, as the Cold War reached its twilight, Gordievsky helped the West turn the tables on the KGB, exposing Russian spies and helping to foil countless intelligence plots, as the Soviet leadership grew increasingly paranoid at the United States's nuclear first-strike capabilities and brought the world closer to the brink of war. Desperate to keep the circle of trust close, MI6 never revealed Gordievsky's name to its counterparts in the CIA, which in turn grew obsessed with figuring out the identity of Britain's obviously top-level source. Their obsession ultimately doomed Gordievsky: the CIA officer assigned to identify him was none other than Aldrich Ames, the man who would become infamous for secretly spying for the Soviets.|With a new afterword--Cover.|xii, 370 pages, 32 unnumbered pages of plates : colour illustrations, portraits ; 20 cm||327.124|BOOK - Book|[2019]|2019|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780241972137?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dFgvuwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Kroeber|Economic development China., China Economic policy 2000-, China Economic conditions 2000-|Business & Economics|This book is an effort to explain how China's economy got to where it is today, where it might be headed in the coming years, and what China's rise means for the rest of the world. It is intended to be useful to the general reader, who has an intelligent interest in China and its global impact but not necessarily a specialized background in either China or economics. Since the first edition was published in 2016 China's relevance to the world has increased dramatically, thanks to the more assertive foreign policy of president Xi Jinping and the move by the United States under the Trump Administration to treat China as a geopolitical rival. Because of its sheer size, the growing tensions with the United States, and the gulf in basic values between China and the international system it increasingly seeks to influence, understanding modern China's origins and trajectory is more important than ever. An economy is a complicated organism, which does not easily lend itself to description by narrative, as one might tell the story of a person's life. It is more like a jigsaw puzzle-to be precise, a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, in which the shapes of the pieces keep changing. Rather than a fixed structure like a molecule, a skyscraper, or a mathematical equation, an economy is a set of fairly solid institutions and fairly fluid arrangements created by people to enable them to get the goods and services that they want. The nature of these institutions and arrangements is largely determined by the political bargains made among the important groups in a society. As the composition, relative power, and interests of these groups change over time, so do the economic arrangements. In other words, considerations of political practicality usually trump those of economic efficiency. For economic policymakers, this means that they must make do with second- or third-best versions of their ideal recipes. For analysts, it means that describing an economy is more of a historical art than a natural science. To the extent it is a science, it is more physiology than physics--Provided by publisher.||xvi, 434 pages : illustrations ; 22 cm.||330.951|BOOK - Book|[2020]|2020-07|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780190946463?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dp7WyQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The largest exporter in the US, it played a central role in the early days of commercial flight, World War II bombing missions, and moon landings. It remains a linchpin in the awesome routine of air travel today. But the two crashes of its 737 MAX 8, in 2018 and 2019, exposed a shocking pattern of malfeasance, leading to the biggest crisis in the company's history. How did things go so horribly wrong at Boeing? Flying Blind is the definitive exposeÌ of a corporate scandal that has transfixed the world. It reveals how a broken corporate culture paved the way for disaster, losses that were altogether avoidable. Drawing from aviation insiders, as well as exclusive interviews with senior Boeing staff, past and present, it shows how in its race to beat Airbus, Boeing skimped on testing, outsourced critical software to unreliable third-parties, and convinced regulators to put planes into service without properly equipping pilots to fly them. In the chill that it cast over its workplace, it offers a parable for a corporate America that puts the interests of shareholders over customers, employees, and communities. This is a searing account of how a once-iconic company fell prey to a win-at-all-costs mentality, destabilizing an industry and needlessly sacrificing 350 lives--Provided by publisher.||vi, 327 pages ; 25 cm||338.762|BOOK - Book|[2021]|2021-11-30|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780385546492?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wEGNEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

In this critical take on China's future, economist George Magnus explores four key traps that China must confront and overcome in order to thrive: debt, middle income, the Renminbi, and an aging population. Looking at the political direction President Xi Jinping is taking, Magnus argues that Xi's authoritarian and repressive philosophy is ultimately not compatible with the country's economic aspirations. Thorough and well researched, the book also investigates the potential for conflicts over trade, China's evolving relationship with Trump, and the country's attempt to win influence and control in Eurasia through the Belt and Road initiative.-- Provided by publisher.||xviii, 264 pages ; 20 cm||330.951|BOOK - Book|2019.|2019-08-06|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780300246636?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=89iUwgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

How hundreds of thousands of men, and mountains of material, were transported across the English Channel, is as dramatic a human achievement as any battlefield exploit. The brutal landings on the five beaches and subsequent battles across the plains and through the lanes and hedgerows of Normandy--a campaign that, in terms of daily casualties, was worse than any in World War I--come vividly to life in conferences where the strategic decisions of Eisenhower, Rommel, Montgomery, and other commanders were made, and through the memories of paratrooper Lieutenant Dick Winters of Easy Company, British corporal and tanker Reg Spittles, Thunderbolt pilot Archie Maltbie, German ordinance officer Hans Heinze, French resistance leader Robert Leblanc, and many others. For both sides, the challenges were enormous. The Allies confronted a disciplined German army stretched to its limit, which nonetheless caused tactics to be adjusted on the fly. Ultimately ingenuity, determination, and immense materiel strength--delivered with operational brilliance--made the difference. A stirring narrative by a pre-eminent historian, Normandy '44 offers important new perspective on one of history's most dramatic military engagements and is an invaluable addition to the literature of war.||lx, 649 pages, 16 unnumbered leaves of unnumbered plates : illustrations, maps, black and white photographs ; 24 cm.||940.542|BOOK - Book|2019.|2019|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780802129420?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RyUavAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Yet, despite, or perhaps because of, the degree of international attention it receives, the conflict is still widely misunderstood. While Israelis and Palestinians and their respective supporters trade accusations, many outside observers remain confused by the conflict's complexity and perplexed by the passion it arouses. The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict : What Everyone Needs to KnowÂ® offers an even-handed and judicious guide to the world's most intractable dispute. Writing in an engaging, jargon-free Q&A format, Dov Waxman provides clear and concise answers to common questions, from the most basic to the most contentious. Covering the conflict from its nineteenth-century origins to the latest developments of the twenty-first century, this book explains the key events, examines the core issues, and presents the competing claims and narratives of both sides. Readers will learn what the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is all about, how it has evolved over time, and why it continues to defy diplomatic efforts at a resolution. -- (Source of summary not specified)||xviii, 265 pages : maps ; 21 cm.||956.04|BOOK - Book|2019.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780190625320?s=MD|

This instinct to take every measure, even the most aggressive, to defend the Jewish people is hardwired into Israel's DNA. From the very beginning of its statehood in 1948, protecting the nation from harm has been the responsibility of its intelligence community and armed services, and there is one weapon in their vast arsenal that they have relied upon to thwart the most serious threats. Targeted assassinations have been used countless times, on enemies large and small, sometimes in response to attacks against the Israeli people and sometimes preemptively. Journalist and military analyst Ronen Bergman offers an inside account of the targeted killing programs: their successes, their failures, and the moral and political price exacted on the men and women who approved and carried out the missions. Bergman has gained the rare cooperation of many current and former members of the Israeli government, including Prime Ministers Shimon Peres, Ehud Barak, Ariel Sharon, and Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as high-level figures in the country's military and intelligence services: the IDF (Israel Defense Forces), the Mossad (the world's most feared intelligence agency), Caesarea (a Mossad within the Mossad that carries out attacks on the highest-value targets), and the Shin Bet (an internal security service that implemented the largest targeted assassination campaign ever, in order to stop what had once appeared to be unstoppable: suicide terrorism). Bergman traces, from statehood to the present, the gripping events and thorny ethical questions underlying Israel's targeted killing campaign, which has shaped the Israeli nation, the Middle East, and the entire world. -- (Source of summary not specified)||xxiv, 753 pages, 32 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations (some color) ; 25 cm||320.956|BOOK - Book|[2018]||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781400069712?s=MD|

Finkelstein|Human rights Gaza Strip., Palestinian Arabs Crimes against Gaza Strip., Arab-Israeli conflict 1993-, Gaza Strip History 21st century.|History|Gaza is among the most densely populated places in the world. Two-thirds of its inhabitants are refugees, and more than half the population is under eighteen years of age. Since Israel occupied Gaza in 1967, it has systematically de-developed the economy. After Hamas won democratic elections in 2006, Israel intensified its blockade of Gaza, and after Hamas consolidated its control of the territory in 2007, Israel tightened its illegal siege another notch. In the meantime, Israel has launched no less than eight military operations against Gaza--culminating in Operation Cast Lead in 2008-9 and Operation Protective Edge in 2014--that left behind over three million tons of rubble. Recent UN reports predict that Gaza will be unlivable by 2020. Norman G. Finkelstein presents a meticulously researched and devastating inquest into Israel's actions of the last decade. He argues that although Israel justified its blockade and violent assaults in the name of self-defense, in fact these actions were cynical exercises of brutal power against an essentially defenseless civilian population. Based on hundreds of human rights reports, the book scrutinizes multifarious violations of international law Israel committed both during its operations and in the course of its decade-long siege of Gaza. It is a monument to Gaza's martyrs and a scorching accusation against their tormentors--Provided by publisher.||xv, 419 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm||953.1|BOOK - Book|[2018]|2018-01-09|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780520295711?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qo84DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

This conflict between the world's two most powerful nations wouldn't have happened, were it not for an unnecessary clash of false narratives. America falsely blames its trade and technology threats on China yet overlooks its shaky saving foundation. China falsely blames its growth challenges on America's alleged containment of market-based socialism, ignoring its failed economic rebalancing. In a hard-hitting analysis of both nations' economies, politics, and policies, Stephen Roach argues that much of the rhetoric on both sides is dangerously misguided, amplified by information distortion, and more a reflection of each nation's fears and vulnerabilities than a credible assessment of the risks they face. Outlining the disastrous toll of conflict escalation between China and America, Roach offers a new road map to restoring a mutually advantageous relationship.--Book jacket.||x, 437 pages : illustrations ; 25 cm||327.73|BOOK - Book|[2022]||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780300259643?s=MD|

The hierarchy of caste is not about feelings or morality. It is about power--which groups have it and which do not. In this book, Isabel Wilkerson gives us a portrait of an unseen phenomenon in America as she explores, through an immersive, deeply researched narrative and stories about real people, how America today and throughout its history has been shaped by a hidden caste system, a rigid hierarchy of human rankings. Beyond race, class, or other factors, there is a powerful caste system that influences people's lives and behavior and the nation's fate. Linking the caste systems of America, India, and Nazi Germany, Wilkerson explores eight pillars that underlie caste systems across civilizations, including divine will, bloodlines, stigma, and more. Using riveting stories about people--including Martin Luther King, Jr., baseball's Satchel Paige, a single father and his toddler son, Wilkerson herself, and many others--she shows the ways that the insidious undertow of caste is experienced every day. She documents how the Nazis studied the racial systems in America to plan their out-cast of the Jews; she discusses why the cruel logic of caste requires that there be a bottom rung for those in the middle to measure themselves against; she writes about the surprising health costs of caste, in depression and life expectancy, and the effects of this hierarchy on our culture and politics. Finally, she points forward to ways America can move beyond the artificial and destructive separations of human divisions, toward hope in our common humanity-- Provided by the publisher.|Oprah's book club, 2020--Book jacket.|xvii, 476 pages ; 25 cm||305.512|BOOK - Book|[2020]||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593230251?s=MD|

When is the best moment to deliver a counter-attack? What is the effect of shock action or defence in depth? Certain tactical concepts have stood the test of time. This ground-breaking book examines, in a series of case studies, 25 of the key tactics that have achieved victory through the ages. Drawing on examples of battles from around the globe, on land, at sea and in the air, and across history, the authors reveal the enduring value of each tactic in clear and compelling descriptions and analysis. General Robert E. Lee, although heavily outnumbered achieved a remarkable victory through an audacious flanking manoeuvre at Chancellorsville in 1863; the same bold move had been used over 600 years before by the king of France at Bouvines. For the Parthian general Surenas at Carrhae in 53 BC and again for Kitchener at Omdurman in 1989, an overwhelming concentration of firepower ensured a decisive outcome, while drawing the enemy led to victory both for Saladin at Hattin in 1187 and for the Russians against Napoleon in 1812. The book examines how Allied armies seized and retained the initiative through the airborne landings in Normandy in 1944, and how Soviet General Zhukov pierced enemy lines and penetrated in depth using Blitzkriegtactics in Mongolia in 1939.|First published: 2010.|237 pages : illustrations, maps ; 20 cm||355.42|BOOK - Book|2020.|2020|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780500295892?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VXtmzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

He golfed with presidents, mingled with movie stars, and was idolized for growing GE into the most valuable company in the world. But Welch's achievements didn't stem from some greater intelligence or business prowess. Rather, they were the result of a sustained effort to push GE's stock price ever higher, often at the expense of workers, consumers, and innovation. In this captivating, revelatory book, David Gelles argues that Welch single-handedly ushered in a new, cutthroat era of American capitalism that continues to this day. Gelles chronicles Welch's campaign to vaporize hundreds of thousands of jobs in a bid to boost profits, eviscerating the country's manufacturing base and destabilizing the middle class. Welch's obsession with downsizing--he eliminated 10% of employees every year--fundamentally altered GE and inspired generations of imitators who have employed his strategies at other companies around the globe. In his day, Welch was corporate America's leading proponent of mergers and acquisitions, using deals to gobble up competitors and giving rise to an economy that is more concentrated and less dynamic. And Welch pioneered the dark arts of financialization, transforming GE from an admired industrial manufacturer into what was effectively an unregulated bank. The finance business was hugely profitable in the short term and helped Welch keep GE's stock price ticking up. But ultimately, financialization undermined GE and dozens of other Fortune 500 companies. Gelles shows how Welch's celebrated emphasis on increasing shareholder value by any means necessary (layoffs, outsourcing, offshoring, acquisitions, and buybacks, to name but a few tactics) became the norm in American business generally. He demonstrates how that approach has led to the greatest socioeconomic inequality since the Great Depression and harmed many of the very companies that have embraced it. And he shows how a generation of Welch acolytes radically transformed companies like Boeing, Home Depot, Kraft Heinz, and more. Finally, Gelles chronicles the change that is now afoot in corporate America, highlighting companies and leaders who have abandoned Welchism and are proving that it is still possible to excel in the business world without destroying livelihoods, gutting communities, and spurning regulation -- Amazon.||264 pages ; 24 cm||330.973|BOOK - Book|2022.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781982176440?s=MD|

Zimmerman.||Zimmerman, James M.|Zimmerman, James M.||Lincheng Xian (China) History 20th century., Hijacking of trains China History 20th century., Train robberies China Lincheng Xian History 20th century., True crime stories.||In 1923 Shanghai, native and foreign travelers alike are enthralled by the establishment of a new railway line to distant Peking. With this new line comes the Peking Express, a luxurious express train on the cutting edge of China's continental transportation. Among those drawn to the train are oil heiress Lucy Aldrich, journalist John Benjamin Powell, and vacationing Army Majors Roland Pinger and Scott Allen, wives and children in tow. These errant Americans and their eclectic fellow passengers all eagerly anticipate an idyllic overnight journey in first class. But the train's passengers are not the only ones enchanted by the Peking Express. The bandit revolutionary Sun Mei-yao sees in it the promise of a reckoning long overdue. From his vantage in Shantung Province, a conflict-ravaged region through which the train must pass, he identifies the Peking Express as a means of commanding the global stage. By disrupting the train and taking its wealthy passengers hostage, he can draw international attention to the plight of Shantung and, he hopes, thereby secure a solution. In the first hours of May 6, 1923, Sun and his bandit troops enact their daring plan. Wrested from the pleasures of their luxury cabins, dozens of travelers including Aldrich, Powell, Pinger, and Allen are plunged into the unfamiliar Shantung terrain. Pursued by warlords and led by their captors, they must make their way to the bandits' mountain stronghold and there await their fate. The Peking Express is the incredible, long-forgotten story of a hostage crisis that shocked China and the West. It vividly captures the events that made international headlines and later inspired Josef von Sternberg's 1932 Hollywood masterpiece Shanghai Express. James M. Zimmerman is a Beijing-based lawyer who has lived and worked in China for over 25 years. He is among China's leading foreign lawyers and represents companies and individuals confronted with the political and legal complexities of doing business in Mainland China.

In the early 2000s, Adrian Hong was a soft-spoken Yale undergraduate looking for his place in the world. After reading a harrowing account of life inside North Korea, he realized he had found a cause so pressing that he was ready to devote his life to it. What began as a trip down the safe and well-worn path of organizing soon morphed into something more dangerous. Hong journeyed to China, outwitting Chinese security services as he helped ferry asylum-seeking North Korean escapees to safety. Meanwhile, Hong's secret organization, Cheollima Civil Defense (later renamed Free Joseon), began tracking the North Korean government's activities, and its volatile third-generation ruler, Kim Jong Un. Free Joseon targeted North Korean diplomats who might be persuaded to defect, while drawing up plans for a government-in-exile. After the shocking broad-daylight assassination in 2017 of Kim Jong Nam, the dictator's older brother, Hong, along with Marine veteran Christopher Ahn, helped ferry Nam's family to safety. Then Hong took the group a step further. He initiated a series of high-stakes direct actions, culminating in an armed raid at the North Korean embassy in Madrid-an act that would put Ahn behind bars and turn Hong into one of the world's most unlikely fugitives. In the tradition of Jon Krakauer's Into the Wild, The Rebel and the Kingdom is an exhilarating account of a man who turns his back on the status quo-to instead live boldly by his principles. Acclaimed journalist and bestselling author Bradley Hope-who broke numerous details of Hong's operations in The Wall Street Journal-now reveals the full contours of this remarkable story of idealism and insanity, hubris and heroism, all set within the secret battle for the future of the world's most mysterious and unsettling nation--Publisher's description.||xvi, 242 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates : colour illustrations, map ; 24 cm||951.93|BOOK - Book|2022.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781399806176?s=MD|

For seven decades, NATO's stated aim has been the achievement of world peace--but playing great power politics always involves conflict. Russia's war on Ukraine and on Europe's security order puts the alliance under threat, but also demonstrates why transatlantic cooperation is so necessary. But how did NATO get to where it is today, and what does its future hold? In this incisive new account, Sten Rynning traces the full history of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation from its origins to the present. Across its seventy-five years, NATO has navigated the twists and turns of Cold War diplomacy and nuclear deterrence, and has grown its membership. The alliance has become a guarantor of peace, but Rynning explores how its complex inner workings alongside Russian and Chinese opposition are now shaping its direction.

The decline of this group, a demographic of our country that has been slowly disintegrating over forty years, has been reported on with growing frequency and alarm. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck. The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.'s grandparents were dirt poor and in love, and moved north from Kentucky's Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them.

Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu viewed the world--and especially the Middle East--differently. The US president wanted to end what he saw as America's perpetual war against the Muslim and Arab worlds, use diplomacy to bring about a Palestinian state coexisting peacefully with Israel, and apply his signature foreign policy vision to reward the Islamic Republic of Iran in exchange for the scaling back of their nuclear pursuits. The Israeli premier wanted his country to thrive without the senseless bloodshed of terror and violence, and he was determined to protect the Jewish state from threats of annihilation by a member of the axis of evil that would one day be armed with nuclear weapons. Netanyahu wanted peace for peace, as well as the acceptance of Israel as a full-fledged part of the Middle East. In 2014, during a pivotal summer of terrorist violence, a war in Gaza, and the advancement of a nuclear deal with Iran, the two men clashed, threatening the US-Israeli strategic alliance and the future of the region. The Middle East would never be the same--Amazon.||298 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations ; 24 cm||956.94|BOOK - Book|[2024]|2024-01-23|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9798888450130?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RZ4C0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

For years, Walmart and Amazon operated in separate spheres-one a massive brick-and-mortar retailer, the other an online giant. But in 2016, Walmart aggressively moved into the world of e-commerce, while Amazon made big bets in physical retail.  The resulting rivalry is a bare-knuckle power struggle as each titan tries to outmaneuver the other to become the biggest omnichannel retailer in the world. As the two megacorporations have consolidated power, troubling consequences have also emerged-for consumers and small merchants faced with fewer buying and selling options, and for millions of workers paid meager wages for demanding and sometimes dangerous work.  Winner Sells All is a tale of disruption and big money moves, with legendary executives and fearless entrepreneurs in a battle-between rival corporations and sometimes even within the same company-to invent the future and cement their own legacies. Veteran journalist Jason Del Rey chronicles the defining business clash of this generation-a war waged for our loyalty and our wallets, with hundreds of billions of dollars at stake and millions of jobs on the line. As both companies continue to expand their empires into new industries, Winner Sells All reveals how this battle will change the ways we shop, live, and work-for decades to come.||1 online resource||381.109|BOOK - Book|[2023]|2023-06-20|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780063076327?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lIlkzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Most of the protein in your diet comes from bugs, while lab-grown meats are a rare, expensive delicacy. You are not allowed to have more than one child, and your financial and medical data are instantly transferred to a centralized government database via a subdermal microchip. Controligarchs warns that this will be our existence if the supranational elites of the World Economic Forum get their way. Bruner, the Director of Research at the Government Accountability Institute led by famed investigator Peter Schweizer, presents a mountain of original research and reveals shocking new evidence that shows their sinister agenda will soon become reality. For example, the Controligarchs are: Funding eugenics research that will allow them to pre-determine their children's traits, creating a new caste system in which the ultrawealthy are able to hack their own biology--augmenting their intelligence with AI--to become superhuman or, they hope, immortal; Bagging billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded crony stimulus and other forms of inflation-inducing corporate welfare that has allowed this tiny elite faction to double their net worth--adding trillions of dollars to their collective holdings--while the middle and lower classes work harder to earn less; Planning for the next pandemic, which means reinstating their lockdowns, implementing new waves of small business closures, and, ultimately, consolidating the ownership--of everything--into fewer and fewer hands. Bruner offers a gripping and groundbreaking look into the shadowy meetings and sweetheart deals behind global social-engineering efforts, proving that, despite their stated intentions, we must never cede control of our lives to billionaires. Amidst daily disasters ranging from bank collapses to disease outbreaks to food and energy crises--each caused or exacerbated by the expert class--this page-turning investigation into the global elite is a must read-- Provided by publisher.||xiv, 367 pages ; 24 cm||321.5|BOOK - Book|[2023]|2023-11-14|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593541593?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kVy3EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

War clouds with Japan are gathering and the islands of Hawaii have become battlegrounds of spies, intelligence agents, and military officials - with the island's residents caught between them. Toiling in the shadows are Douglas Wada, the only Japanese American agent in naval intelligence, and Takeo Yoshikawa, a Japanese spy sent to Pearl Harbor to gather information on the U.S. fleet. Douglas Wada's experiences in his native Honolulu include posing undercover as a newspaper reporter, translating wiretaps on the Japanese Consulate, and interrogating America's first captured POW of World War II, a submarine officer found on the beach. Takeo Yoshikawa is a Japanese spy operating as a junior diplomat with the consulate who is collecting vital information that goes straight to Admiral Yamamoto. Their dueling stories anchor Ghosts of Honolulu's gripping depiction of the world-changing cat and mouse games played between Japanese and US military intelligence agents (and a mercenary Nazi) in Hawaii before the outbreak of the second world war. Also caught in the upheaval are Honolulu's innocent residents--including Douglas Wada's father--who endure the war's anti-Japanese fervor and a cadre of intelligence professionals who must prevent Hawaii from adopting the same destructive mass internments as California. Scrutinizing long-buried historical documents, NCIS star Mark Harmon and co-author Leon Carroll, a former NCIS Special Agent, have brought forth a true-life NCIS story of deception, discovery, and danger. Ghosts of Honolulu depicts the incredible high stakes game of naval intelligence and the need to define what is real and what only appears to be real.||xiv, 254 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm||327.12|BOOK - Book|[2023]|2023-11-14|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781400337019?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0hm5zwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Diving deeply into Islamic theology, and also sharing lessons from his own life story, he reveals how Muslims lost the universalism that made them a great civilization in their earlier centuries. He especially demonstrates how values often associated with Western Enlightenment - freedom, reason, tolerance, and an appreciation of science - had Islamic counterparts, which sadly were cast aside in favor of more dogmatic views, often for political ends. Elucidating complex ideas with engaging prose and storytelling, Reopening Muslim Minds borrows lost visions from medieval Muslim thinkers such as Ibn Rushd (aka Averroes), to offer a new Muslim worldview on a range of sensitive issues: human rights, equality for women, freedom of religion, or freedom from religion.

Take the scenic route through Europe. When it comes to beautiful landscapes, Europe has more than its fair share of icons. The snowy peaks of the Alps, the vivid tulip fields of the Netherlands and the glittering lakes of northern Italy - you'll find them nowhere else but here. Yet pause to look around a little longer, and you'll soon discover that these postcard favourites sit side by side with many more understated scenes that are just as stunning. In fact, the slower you go, the more treasures you'll uncover - so why would you want to rush the experience? Featuring over 150 inspirational entries, Unforgettable Journeys Europe is a vibrant celebration of taking the scenic route. We've picked the best adventures across the continent, from cruising around the Western Fjords of Norway to hiking the Lycian Way in Turkey. Of course, the big-hitters are covered - riding Switzerland's Glacier Express, ferry-hopping in Greece and cycling from Land's End to John O'Groats - but we also take you off-the-beaten path, roaming the Albanian Riviera, kayaking through Finnish lakeland and navigating the steady switchbacks of the Transfagarasan Road in Romania. We've organized the book by types of transport, so whether you're an avid hiker, cyclist or driver, or love to be on the water or on the rails, we've got you covered.

The two sides' forces brought very different strengths and limitations to the conflict. In 1937 China was divided into factions, each controlled by warlords with independent forces, and there was no unified Chinese army. In order to fight the Japanese Chiang Kai-shek, the nominal leader of Nationalist China, was compelled to do deals with these regional powers.  For their part, the Japanese employed ground forces broadly comparable to those fielded by Western powers, including modern artillery and tanks. Featuring specially commissioned artwork and drawing upon an array of sources, this study investigates the origins, training, doctrine and armament of the Chinese and Japanese forces who fought in the opening stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War.--Provided by publisher.||80 pages : illustrations (some colour) ; 25 cm.||951.042|BOOK - Book|2018.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781472828200?s=MD|

But Turtle Island has its dark side. In 2014, Koh Tao was the site of the brutal double murders of two British backpackers, but theirs weren't the only suspicious backpacker deaths... In 'THE CURSE OF THE TURTLE' readers can make up their own minds on who is responsible for the murders that so devastated the victims' families. Were the Burmese migrant workers responsible? Or were the powerful, tribal families who run Koh Tao involved? And if so, were they aided by corrupt law enforcement?--Backcover.||376 pages : illustrations ; 22 cm||364.152|BOOK - Book|[2022]|2022-03|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781952225994?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IZrvzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Democracy, populism, liberalism, conservatism, socialism, nationalism, feminism, and abolitionism are all heirs to the momentous upheaval that began in Paris in 1789. Historian Jeremy Popkin offers a riveting account of the Revolution that puts the reader in the thick of the debates and the turmoil that led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of a new society. Going beyond the typical cast of Robespierre, Danton, and Mirabeau, Popkin includes the women who demanded equal rights and the enslaved blacks who wrested freedom from revolutionaries to recount how people sought to make themselves 'free and equal in rights.' From the drafting of the Declaration of the Rights of Man to the rise of Napoleon out of the ashes of the Reign of Terror, [this book] is a history of the French Revolution for our own time. Even after more than two hundred years, Popkin argues, the principles of the French Revolution continue to guide the search for a just society. Based on decades of scholarship, A New World Begins is a magisterial account of the revolution that created the modern world--Jacket||viii, 627 pages : illustrations, maps ; 21 cm||944.04|BOOK - Book|2021|2021-10-26|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781541620179?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eRI6zgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

This is the definitive way to discover the real, modern Europe progressively unfolding, because looking back to the past reveals more about our future than we ever expected, and only by knowing how Europe came to be, can we know what really lies ahead.Whilst experiencing constant turbulence and change, Europe has made an astonishing mark on the world. How did one small continent become so powerful? How did such diverse islands come together to act as one? How did a diplomatic society descend into bloodshed and what does that mean for Europe today? For two-millenia Europe has been a superpower; it's fretted coastlines, it's many religions and revolutions have all shaped what it is now, and with more change ahead Jean-Baptiste Duroselle's Europe including a special and up-to-date afterword from Anthony Teasdale, Director General for Parliamentary research and former Special Advisor for the Deputy Prime Minister, couldn't be better timed.

You bet. Elusive? Not quite. From Antarctica and the Amazon to Victoria Falls and the Great Wall of China, Lonely Planet reveals 101 spectacular sights and how to see them on any budget. Inspiring and practical, with expert advice on how and when to visit, where to stay and a range of itineraries, you'll discover how to visit the world's wonders in a way that suits you. This collection includes both natural and human-made sights across the world. We've selected locations that represent the best and most extraordinary 'places to be seen'. There are sights that most people have heard of: the Taj Mahal, Angkor Wat and the Great Wall of China. But also less famous sights that cannot fail to captivate: the entwined tree bridges of Meghalaya in India, the intricate Islamic architecture of Naqsh-e Jahan in Iran, and the massive Buddhist temple of Borobudur in central Java. We've added museums with remarkable collections of wonders too, such as the Rijksmuseum in the Netherlands and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. The planet's natural wonders are no less awesome: giant trees in California, cascading lakes in Croatia, multi-colored hills in China, great waterfalls, and natural phenomena like the wave of cherry blossom that sweeps across Japan each spring, and the light show of the auroras across the planet's northern and southern extremities. The book also explains how you can visit each wonder, whatever your budget. We've compiled a guide to each one that recommends the best times to visit, how to get there, and where to stay and eat--however much you want to spend.|Includes index.|368 pages : color illustrations, color maps ; 28 cm||910.202|BOOK - Book|2019.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781788682329?s=MD|

Zaloga|M26 (Tank), Tiger II (Tank), World War, 1939-1945 Campaigns Western Front., World War, 1939-1945 Tank warfare.|History|During the final battles on World War II's Western Front, the legendary German Tiger I heavy tank clashed with the brand-new M26 Pershing fielded by the United States. The Tiger I had earned a formidable reputation by the end of 1944, although its non-sloped armor and poor mobility meant it was being superseded by the Tiger II or King Tiger. While the Tiger I had been in the front lines since 1942, the US Pershing first entered combat in late February 1945, and more than 20 Pershings would see action before war's end. This book examines the dramatic Tiger/Pershing duel at Elsdorf in Germany, and also assesses the clashes between German armor and the sole Super Pershing deployed to Europe. Featuring full-color artwork, carefully chosen photographs, and specially commissioned maps, this is the story of the first US heavy tanks in combat with the fearsome Tiger I during the last months of World War II in Europe.||80 pages : illustrations (some color), maps ; 25 cm.||940.542|BOOK - Book|2017.|2017-09-19|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781472817167?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T-slEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

McNall.||McNall, Joshua M.|McNall, Joshua M.||Atonement., Salvation Christianity.||While Jesus saves remains the central claim of Christianity, the ensuing question, How?, demands attention. How exactly does a brutal and shameful crucifixion bring salvation? Why does the Bible call it good news, and why should we? In How Jesus Saves, Joshua McNall unpacks the meaning of Jesus's life and death for everyday people. Through Scripture, story, and real-life applications, he brings together the primary models of atonement doctrine and offers an integrated vision for how Jesus offers the benefits of salvation to the world. The result is an accessible book that helps remove obstacles for skeptics and can deepen the faith of committed Christians. In both the book and accompanying videos (available separately), McNall addresses this great Christian doctrine with simplicity without sacrificing the nuance this topic demands--Back cover.||145 pages : illustrations ; 21 cm||232.3|BOOK - Book|[2023]||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781628240412?s=MD|

Meritocracy cuts to the heart of who we are. It sustains the American dream. But what if, both up and down the social ladder, meritocracy is a sham? Today, upward mobility has become a fantasy. The embattled middle classes are now more likely to sink into the working poor than to rise into the professional elite, and even the rich adults who manage to claw their way to the top are required to work with crushing intensity. All this is not the result of deviations or retreats from meritocracy but rather stems directly from meritocracy's successes. This is the radical argument that Yale professor Daniel Markovits prosecutes with rare force. In The Meritocracy Trap, he reveals not only the inner workings of the meritocratic machine but also the first steps toward a world that might once again afford dignity and prosperity to the American people--Back cover.|First published: New York : Penguin Press, 2019.|xxiii, 418 pages : illustrations ; 22 cm||305.55|BOOK - Book|2020.|2020-09-08|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780735222014?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7fP2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

With the fourth largest population in the world, inhabiting islands that span an eighth of the globe, Indonesia became the first country to rid itself of colonial rule after World War II. In this vivid history, renowned scholar and celebrated author of Congo David Van Reybrouck captures a period of extraordinary tumult and chaos to tell the story of Indonesia's momentous revolution, known as the Revolusi. Encompassing several hundred years of history, he details the formation of the Dutch East Indies, the Japanese invasion that followed, and the young rebels who engaged in armed resistance once the occupation ended. British and Dutch troops were sent to restore order and keep peace, but instead ignited the first modern war of decolonization. America, too, became embroiled with the Indonesians' fierce struggle for freedom. That struggle inspired independence movements in Asia, Africa, and the Arab world, especially in the wake of Indonesia's monumental 1955 Bandung Conference, the first global conference without the West. The whole world had become involved in Revolusi, and the whole world was changed by it. Drawing on hundreds of interviews and eyewitness testimonies, David Van Reybrouck turns this vast and complex story into an utterly gripping narrative, written with remarkable historical clarity and filled with tragedy and passion. A landmark history, Revolusi cements Indonesia's struggle for independence as one of the defining dramas of the twentieth century and entirely reframes our understanding of post-colonialism.-- Provided by publisher.|Originally published in Dutch as Revolusi: IndonesieÌ en het ontstaan van de moderne wereld by Bezige Bij in 2020-- Title page verso.122|x, 639 pages : illustrations, maps ; 24 cm||959.8|BOOK - Book|2024.|2024-04-09|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781324073697?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lA3wzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Its vast economy and growing regional aggression make it a threat to supersede the United States as the world's dominant power. But this outcome is far from inevitable. Like neighboring Russia-which harbors global ambitions of its own-right now China is at a turning point. Whereas international sanctions and a turn away from fossil fuels are steadily smothering Russia, China's downfall will be its shrinking population. Its chance to achieve global hegemony will soon disappear, making its quest for power both less certain and more dangerous. In World on the Brink, security expert Dmitri Alperovitch breaks down not only the significant weaknesses that have so far prevented China from surpassing the United States, but also the key strategies that will enable the U. S. to maintain primacy even as China ramps up its efforts. Cultivating crucial alliances, fostering domestic innovation in emerging tech fields, and stabilizing international relations with adversarial nations are all vital components to building a robust strategy in anticipation of a new cold war that seems more likely every day. As Alperovitch explains, we must play to our strengths and address our weaknesses, using our leverage as the strongest nation on the planet to tactfully navigate the next cold war. This sharp, timely book is the essential blueprint for doing just that--Provided by publisher.||v, 390 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm||327.73|BOOK - Book|2024.|2024-04-30|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781541704091?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pAQY0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Cline|Bronze age Mediterranean Region., Mediterranean Region Civilization., Mediterranean Region History To 476., Sea Peoples., Bronze age, Civilization, Sea Peoples, Mediterranean Region, To 476, History|History|In 1177 B.C., marauding groups known only as the Sea Peoples invaded Egypt. The pharaoh's army and navy managed to defeat them, but the victory so weakened Egypt that it soon slid into decline, as did most of the surrounding civilizations. After centuries of brilliance, the civilized world of the Bronze Age came to an abrupt and cataclysmic end. Kingdoms fell like dominoes over the course of just a few decades. No more Minoans or Mycenaeans. No more Trojans, Hittites, or Babylonians. The thriving economy and cultures of the late second millennium B.C., which had stretched from Greece to Egypt and Mesopotamia, suddenly ceased to exist, along with writing systems, technology, and monumental architecture. But the Sea Peoples alone could not have caused such widespread breakdown. How did it happen? In this major new account of the causes of this First Dark Ages, Eric Cline tells the gripping story of how the end was brought about by multiple interconnected failures, ranging from invasion and revolt to earthquakes, drought, and the cutting of international trade routes. Bringing to life the vibrant multicultural world of these great civilizations, he draws a sweeping panorama of the empires and globalized peoples of the Late Bronze Age and shows that it was their very interdependence that hastened their dramatic collapse and ushered in a dark age that lasted centuries. A compelling combination of narrative and the latest scholarship, 1177 B.C. sheds new light on the complex ties that gave rise to, and ultimately destroyed, the flourishing civilizations of the Late Bronze Age-and that set the stage for the emergence of classical Greece-- Provided by publisher.||xix, 277 pages : illustrations, maps ; 21 cm.||937.0|BOOK - Book|[2021]|2021-02-02|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780691208015?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CjwCEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Peter Turchin, one of the most interesting social scientists of our age by any measure, has infused the study of history with approaches and insights from other fields for over a quarter century. The Wealth Pump is the culmination of his work to understand what causes political communities to cohere and what causes them to fall apart, as applied to the current turmoil within the United States. Back in 2010, Nature magazine asked Turchin, along with other leading scientists, to provide a ten-year forecast. Based on his models, Turchin predicted that America was in a spiral of social disintegration that would lead to a breakdown in the political order ca 2020. As the years passed, and his prediction proved accurate in more and more respects, attention around his work grew. The Wealth Pump distills his framework, its empirical justification, and its highly relevant findings, into an accessible, thought-provoking book that puts the American story into broad historical context. The lessons of world history are clear, Turchin argues: when the equilibrium between ruling elites and the majority tips too far in favor of elites, political instability is all but inevitable. Before the industrial era, the imbalance between labor and capital, signaled by rising economic inequality, was usually caused by excessive population growth. For the past 250 or so years, it has been laissez-faire government, technological innovation, globalization, and immigration that have tended to disrupt the balance. Whatever the cause, when income inequality surges, the common people suffer, and prosperity flows disproportionately into the hands of the elites. This vicious cycle is the wealth pump--the mechanism that causes both the relative impoverishment of most people and the increasingly desperate competition among elites. And since the number of positions of real social power remains relatively fixed, the overproduction of elites inevitably leads to frustrated elite aspirants, who harness popular resentment to turn against the established order. History shows that when the elite is riven by too many claimants, when counter-elites are powerful enough to lead effective populist uprisings, then the death knell of the established order is nigh. In America, the wealth pump has been operating full blast for two generations. In historical terms, our current cycle of elite overproduction and popular immiseration is far along the path to violent political rupture. Time will tell whether Peter Turchin's warning is heeded--Provided by publisher.||xv, 352 pages ; 24 cm||320.011|BOOK - Book|2023.|2023-06-13|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780241637791?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dONyzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

But what does the world want from China? In a new era of strategic competition between China and the United States, Luke Patey explores how the rest of the world is responding to China's rise. Many fear China's economic power, tech innovations, and growing military might will allow it to remake the world in its own authoritarian image. But despite all its strengths, a future with China in charge is far from certain. China will only rule the 21st century if the world lets it. How China Loses tells the story of China's struggles to overcome new risks and endure the global backlash against its assertive reach. Combining on-the-ground reportage with incisive analysis, Patey argues that China's predatory economic agenda, headstrong diplomacy, and military expansion undermine its global ambitions. In travels to Africa, Latin America, East Asia and Europe, his encounters with activists, business managers, diplomats, and thinkers show the challenges threatening China's rising power. China's relations with the outside world are reaching a critical juncture. Political differences and security tensions have risen, and many countries are now recognizing that economic engagement produces new strategic vulnerabilities to their competitiveness and autonomy. At a time when views from Washington D.C. and Beijing dominate the discussion, Patey's work shows how perspectives from around the world will shape the global economy and world affairs--Provided by publisher.||xi, 383 pages : maps ; 25 cm||303.482|BOOK - Book|[2021]|2021|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780190061081?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6PQTEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Meanwhile, as rival powers including the United States take concerted action to curb Chinese ambitions, the region has emerged as an arena of heated strategic competition. Drawing on more than a decade of on-the-ground experience, Sebastian Strangio explores the impacts of China's rise on Southeast Asia, the varied ways in which the countries of the region are responding, and what it might mean for the future balance of power in the Indo-Pacific.||xv, 337 pages, 12 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations, maps ; 20 cm.||327.51|BOOK - Book|[2020]|2020|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780300257397?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uX2bzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Bunton|Arab-Israeli conflict., Jewish-Arab relations.|History|The conflict between Palestine and Israel is one of the most highly publicized and bitter struggles of modern times, a dangerous tinderbox always poised to set the Middle East aflame, and to draw the United States into the fire. In this volume the author illuminates the history of the problem, reducing it to its very essence. He explores the Palestinian-Israeli dispute in twenty-year segments, to highlight the historical complexity of the conflict throughout successive decades. Each chapter starts with an examination of the relationships among people and events that marked particular years as historical stepping stones in the evolution of the conflict, including the 1897 Basel Congress, the 1917 Balfour Declaration and British occupation of Palestine, and the 1947 U.N. Partition Plan and the war for Palestine. Providing an exploration of the main issues, the author explores not only the historical basis of the conflict, but also looks at how and why partition has been so difficult and how efforts to restore peace continue today.||xvi, 132 pages : illustrations, maps ; 18 cm.||956.94|BOOK - Book|2013.|2013-08-29|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780199603930?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ldgVAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Roman Empire was in conflict during at least 50 per cent of its lifetime. Since 1776, the United States has spent over one hundred years at war. The dream of peace has been universal in the history of humanity. So why have we so rarely been able to achieve it? In A Political History of the World, Jonathan Holslag has produced a sweeping history of the world, from the Iron Age to the present, that investigates the causes of conflict between empires, nations and peoples and the attempts at diplomacy and cosmopolitanism. A birds-eye view of three thousand years of history, the book illuminates the forces shaping world politics from Ancient Egypt to the Han Dynasty, the Pax Romana to the rise of Islam, the Peace of Westphalia to the creation of the United Nations.This truly global approach enables Holslag to search for patterns across different eras and regions, and explore larger questions about war, diplomacy, and power. Has trade fostered peace? What are the limits of diplomacy? How does environmental change affect stability? Is war a universal sin of power? At a time when the threat of nuclear war looms again, this is a much-needed history intended for students of international politics, and anyone looking for a background on current events.||639 pages : maps ; 23 cm.||909.0|BOOK - Book|2018.|2018|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780241352045?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=myArtQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

It was sometimes said that 'One loved money, one loved power and one loved her country', but there was far more to the Soong sisters than these caricatures. As China battled through a hundred years of wars, revolutions and seismic transformations, each sister played an important, sometimes critical role, and left an indelible mark on history. Red Sister, Ching-ling, married Sun Yat-sen, founding father of the Chinese republic, and later became Mao's vice-chair. Little Sister, May-ling, was Madame Chiang Kai-shek, first lady of the pre-Communist Nationalist China and a major political figure in her own right. Big Sister, Ei-ling, was Chiang's unofficial main adviser. She made herself one of China's richest women - and her husband Chiang's prime minister. All three sisters enjoyed tremendous privilege and glory, but also endured constant attacks and mortal danger. They showed great courage and experienced passionate love, as well as despair and heartbreak. The relationship between them was highly charged emotionally, especially once they had embraced opposing political camps and Ching-ling dedicated herself to destroying her two sisters' world. Big Sister, Little Sister, Red Sister is a gripping story of love, war, exile, intrigue, glamour and betrayal, which takes us on a monumental journey, from Canton to Hawaii and New York, from exiles' quarters in Japan and Berlin to secret meeting rooms in Moscow, and from the compounds of the Communist elite in Beijing to the corridors of power in democratic Taiwan. In a group biography that is by turns intimate and epic, Jung Chang reveals the lives of three extraordinary women who helped shape the history of twentieth-century China.||xx, 374 pages, 24 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations, map, portraits ; 24 cm.||951.04|BOOK - Book|2019.|2019|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781910702789?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oNrnwQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

China is one of the oldest states in the world. It achieved its approximate current borders with the Ascendancy of the Yuan dynasty in the thirteenth century, and despite the passing of one Imperial dynasty to the next, has maintained them for the eight centuries since. China remained China through the Ming, the Qing, the Republic, the Occupation, and Communism. But despite the desires of some of the most powerful people in the Great State through the ages, China has never been alone in the world. It has had to contend with invaders as well as foreign traders and imperialists. Its rulers for the majority of the last eight centuries have not been Chinese. China became a mega-state not by conquering others, Timothy Brook contends, but rather by being conquered by others and then claiming right of succession to the empires of those Great States. What the Mongols and Manchu ruling families wrought, the Chinese ruling families of the Ming, the Republic, and the People's Republic, have perpetuated. Yet a contemporary Chinese idea of a 'fatherland' that is, and always has been, completely and naturally Chinese persists. Brook argues that China, like everywhere, is the outcome of history, and like every state, rests on its capacities to conquer and suppress. In The Great State, Brook examines China's relationship with the world at large for the first time, from the Yuan through to the present, by following the stories of ordinary and extraordinary people navigating the spaces where China met, and continues to meet, the world.||xxii, 442 pages, 16 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations (chiefly colour), maps (chiefly colour) ; 20 cm||327.51|BOOK - Book|2022.|2022-09-20|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780063143449?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_lXLzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

As National Security Advisor to Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger transformed America's approach to diplomacy with China, the USSR, Vietnam, and the Middle East, laying the foundations for geopolitics as we know them today. Nearly fifty years later, escalating tensions between the US, China, and Russia are threatening a swift return to the same diplomatic game of tug-of-war that Kissinger played so masterfully. Kissinger on Kissinger is a series of faithfully transcribed interviews conducted by the elder statesman's longtime associate, Winston Lord, which captures Kissinger's thoughts on the specific challenges that he faced during his tenure as NSA, his general advice on leadership and international relations, and stunning portraits of the larger-than-life world leaders of the era. The result is a frank and well-informed overview of US foreign policy in the first half of the 70s -- essential reading for anyone hoping to understand tomorrow's global challenges.--Provided by publisher.|Includes index.|176 pages ; 21 cm||327.73|BOOK - Book|2019.|2019-05-14|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781250219442?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FvfSugEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Participants straddle all stakeholder groups, from the state itself to the private sector to the public at large. Add to that debate increasing globalisation, and now de-globalisation, and the advent of technological advances. Criticism is often levelled at a government that is slow to act or one that belatedly introduces damning regulations. Many governments are already saddled with demands spanning mega infrastructural development to bulging fiscal deficits to evening out growth across the population. The politics of the day are however synonymous with short-termism. The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the bailout burden even more.

The United States' hasty retreat from Afghanistan in 2021 was nothing short of a horror show. Women and children were trampled to death outside the gates of the Kabul airfield. Desperate Afghans clung to the landing gear of departing planes. American civilians and Afghan interpreters were abandoned to the mercy of the Taliban. And 13 U.S. service members were murdered in an ISIS suicide bombing that easily could have been prevented. Two fearless and respected journalists -- the Washington Examiner's Jerry Dunleavy and former U.S. Army Captain James Hasson (Bronze Star, Afghanistan) -- have teamed up to write the hard-hitting book no one else has. Kabul is packed with shocking and infuriating exclusive details about fatal politics and bureaucracy that contributed to the catastrophe. The authors also tell, for the first time, inspiring stories of the bravery and courage exhibited by countless Americans on the ground. Kabul's original reporting includes eyewitness accounts from military leaders who were present at Bagram Air Field when the Biden administration ordered U.S. forces to abandon it. The authors also interview officers, enlisted soldiers, and Marines who participated in the chaotic evacuation of Hamid Karzai International Airport from start to finish. Ultimately, this book is about how the Biden administration's Afghanistan retreat was the start of a far more unpredictable and perilous world and must not be viewed in isolation. While Americans watched the fall of Afghanistan with disbelief, our nation's enemies were also paying close attention--Provided by publisher.||360 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates : colour illustrations ; 23 cm||958.104|BOOK - Book|2023.|2023-08-15|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781546005308?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qfqOzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

These are the islands that Europeans set out on countless voyages to discover and later fought bitterly over in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. This was the land that Christopher Columbus sought and Magellan actually reached and explored. One tiny Indonesian island was even exchanged for the island of Manhattan in 1667! This fascinating book tells the story of Indonesia as a narrative of kings, traders, missionaries, soldiers and revolutionaries--featuring stormy sea crossings, fiery volcanoes, and the occasional tiger. It recounts colorful visits by foreign travelers who passed through these shores for centuries--from Chinese Buddhist pilgrims and Dutch adventurers to English sea captains and American movie stars. For readers who want an entertaining introduction to Asia's most colorful country, this is the perfect book-- Provided by publisher.||288 pages : illustrations, maps ; 21 cm||959.8|BOOK - Book|[2015]|2015-08-18|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780804844765?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IUb-rQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

In mid-2019, he was an unknown junior minister; seven months later, he became Chancellor of the Exchequer; and by October 2022, he had secured the highest office in the land. Aged forty-two, he was Britain's youngest Prime Minister in more than 200 years. Michael Ashcroft's biography - first published in 2020 and now fully revised and updated - charts Sunak's ascent to the University of Oxford, the City of London, Silicon Valley and Westminster before assuming the most powerful job in the country in chaotic circumstances. It is the story of a clever and hard-working son of immigrant parents who marries an heiress and makes a fortune of his own; a polished southerner who wins over the voters of North Yorkshire; a fiscal conservative who becomes the biggest-spending Chancellor in history; and a fastidious political operator tasked with reuniting the Conservative Party and repairing an economy in flux. Casting new light on Sunak's tense working relationship with his predecessor, Boris Johnson, All to Play For shows what makes him tick ahead of a general election whose outcome will have profound consequences for Britain--Publisher's website.|Includes index., Revised edition of 2020's 'Going for broke : the rise of Rishi Sunak'.|xiii, 508 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations, portraits ; 22 cm||941.086|BOOK - Book|2023.|2023-09-19|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781785907968?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZkrLzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Growing up on Cape Cod in the 1960s, Liza Rodman was a lonely little girl. During the summers, while her mother worked days in a local motel and danced most nights in the Provincetown bars, her babysitter--the kind, handsome handyman at the motel where her mother worked--took her and her sister on adventures in his truck. He bought them popsicles and together, they visited his secret garden in the Truro woods. To Liza, he was one of the few kind and understanding adults in her life. Everyone thought he was just a great guy. But there was one thing she didn't know; their babysitter was a serial killer. Some of his victims were buried--in pieces--right there, in his garden in the woods. Though Tony Costa's gruesome case made screaming headlines in 1969 and beyond, Liza never made the connection between her friendly babysitter and the infamous killer of numerous women, including four in Massachusetts, until decades later. Haunted by nightmares and horrified by what she learned, Liza became obsessed with the case. Now, she and cowriter Jennifer Jordan reveal the chilling and unforgettable true story of a charming but brutal psychopath through the eyes of a young girl who once called him her friend-- Provided by publisher.||341 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm||364.152|BOOK - Book|2021|2021-03-02|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781982129477?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1iIZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

His 'Four Modernisations' - reform in agriculture, industry, military, science and technology - unveiled at the Third Plenum of the Central Committee in 1978 undoubtedly paved the way for China's rise to superpower status. Yet, only a decade after this, his greatest achievement, Deng fell dramatically from grace, becoming reviled both within and outside of China as the man responsible for crushing the democracy movement in the carnage of Tiananmen Square.

The raid, Operation  Eagle Claw , was risky to say the least. US forces would have to fly into the deserts of Iran on C-130s; marry up with carrier-based RH-53D helicopters; fly to hide sites near Tehran; approach the Embassy via trucks; seize the Embassy and rescue the hostages; board the helicopters descending on Tehran; fly to an airbase captured by more US forces; and then fly out on C-141s and to freedom. Unfortunately, and unsurprisingly given the complexity of the mission, things went wrong from the start and when the mission was called off at the refueling site at Desert One, the resulting collision between aircraft killed eight US personnel.

How could this happen in twenty-first-century Europe? Why did Putin decide to escalate Russia's war against Ukraine, a war which began with Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014? In this timely book, Gwendolyn Sasse analyses the background to this war and examines the factors that led to Putin's fateful decision. She retraces the history of Ukraine's struggle for independence from Russia and shows how democratic developments in Ukraine had become a risk for Russia's political system. She also shows that ambiguous Western policy towards Russia encouraged elites in the Kremlin to think that they had more room for action than they did. The result is a brilliant analysis of the background to the war, a concise account of the course of the war itself and a timely reflection on what its consequences will be - for Ukraine, for Russia and for the West. An indispensable book for anyone who wants to understand the most dangerous conflict of our time--Amazon.|Originally published in German as Der Krieg gegen die Ukraine.|xii, 157 pages : maps ; 22 cm||947.708|BOOK - Book|2023.|2023-09-21|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781509560608?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aVTwzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Kaplan.|The Loom of Time|Kaplan, Robert D.|Kaplan, Robert D.|Robert D. Kaplan|Imperialism., Middle East Politics and government., Asia, Central Politics and government., Informational works.|History|The Greater Middle East, the vast region between the Mediterranean and China encompassing much of the Arab world, parts of northern Africa, and Asia, existed for millennia as the crossroads of empire: Macedonian, Mongol, Ottoman, Russian, British. But with the dissolution of empires in the twentieth century, postcolonial states have struggled to maintain stability in the face of power struggles between factions, leadership vaccuums, and the fact of arbitrary borders drawn by exiting imperial rulers with little regard for geography or political groups on the ground. In the Loom of Time, Robert Kaplan explores this broad, fraught space to reveal deeper truths about the impacts of history on the present and how the requirements of stability over anarchy are often in conflict with the ideals of democratic governance. In The Loom of Time, Kaplan makes an excellent case for realism the world over, but especially for it as an approach to the Greater Middle East. Just as Western attempts as democracy promotion across the Middle East have failed, a new form of economic imperialism is emerging today as China's ambitions fall squarely within the region as the key link between Europe and East Asia. As in the past, the Greater Middle East will be a register of future great power struggles across the globe. And like in the past, thousands of years of imperial rule will continue to cast a long shadow on politics as it is practiced today--Provided by publisher.||xviii, 374 pages : map ; 25 cm||320.956|BOOK - Book|[2023]|2023-08-22|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593242797?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LYSzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

A land-locked Alcatraz of sorts, its rules enforced with cruel precision, the prison was the pride of a ruthless commandant named Karl Niemeyer. This is the story of a group of ingenious and defiant Allied soldiers and pilots who dared to escape from Holzminden, right under Niemeyer's nose. Leading a team that tunneled through the prison's foundation and far beyond its walls, these breakout artists forged documents, smuggled in supplies, and bribed guards. Twice the tunnel was almost exposed, and the whole plan foiled.

Inside were thirty emaciated men, barely alive, and they had an extraordinary tale to tell. They were survivors of His Majesty's Ship the Wager, which had left England two years earlier on a secret mission during an imperial war with Spain and had been wrecked on a desolate island off the coast of Patagonia. The men, after being marooned for months, built the flimsy craft and sailed for more than a hundred days, traversing nearly 3,000 miles of storm-wracked seas. They were greeted as heroes. Six months, another even more decrepit craft landed on the coast of Chile. This boat contained just three castaways and they told a very different story. The thirty sailors who had landed in Brazil were not heroes - they were mutineers. As accusations of treachery and murder flew, the Admiralty convened a court-martial to determine who was telling the truth. The stakes were life-and-death - for whomever she court found guilty could hang. The Wager is a grand tale of human behaviour at the extremes told by one of our greatest non-fiction writers. As always with Grann's work, the incredible twists of the narrative hold the reader spellbound. Most powerfully, he unearths the deeper meaning of the events, showing it was not only the Wager's captain and crew who were on trial - it was the very idea of empire.|Maps on lining pages., First published: 2023.|xii, 329 pages, 16 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations (chiefly colour), colour maps ; 24 cm||910.916|BOOK - Book|2024.|2024-01-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781471183706?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=43IY0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

His reporting takes readers deep into the elaborate system, showcasing the triumphs and struggles of the human players who operate it--from factories in Asia and an almond grower in Northern California, to a group of striking railroad workers in Texas, to a truck driver who Goodman accompanies across hundreds of miles of the Great Plains. Through their stories, Goodman weaves a powerful argument for reforming a supply chain to become truly reliable and resilient, demanding a radical redrawing of the bargain between labor and shareholders, and deeper attention paid to how we get the things we need--Amazon.||406 pages ; 24 cm||658.7|BOOK - Book|[2024]|2024-06-11|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780063257924?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Fakn0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

But many more do not fulfil the four basic requirements of democracy: free and fair elections, active participation of citizens in politics, protection of human rights, and the rule of law. Since 2015, far-right and populist politicians have been on the rise throughout the West. Is populism the new face of democracy? Is democracy simply the will of the people? Can any existing government claim to be truly democratic? This captivating, articulate volume explores and interrogates each form of democracy and questions whether they remain fit for purpose today.||143 pages : colour illustrations ; 23 cm.||321.8|BOOK - Book|2018.|2018-10-16|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780500293652?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8tSNEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Now, more than twenty-five years later, this compelling journey continues as we follow the fortunes and the dazzling life of the Princess, her friends and her family. But, of course, there is a less glamorous, much darker side to this engaging series, and in Stepping Out of the Shadows Jean and the Princess focus their attention on how, despite positive news on civil rights reforms, Saudi women still suffer physical and psychological abuse and have little legal protection due to the archaic guardianship laws of the land. So, although this is a kingdom on the threshold of revolutionary change change spearheaded by the young Saudi Crown Prince who is keen to modernize his country - any thoughts of equal rights and the chance to lead an independent life remain little more than dreams for most Saudi women. Whilst the Princess acknowledges and welcomes the reforms that are on the horizon, through stories of joy and sorrow, we see how she is determined to continue to fight for equal rights for women in this, her beloved kingdom.||xix, 267 pages : map ; 24 cm||305.42|BOOK - Book|2018.|2018-08-20|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593080504?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i-vetAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

During these centuries Rome gained in splendor and territory, then lost both. The empire reached from modern-day Britain to Iraq, and over time emperors came not from the old Roman families of the first century but from men born in the provinces, some of whom had never even seen Rome. By the time of Constantine, the Roman Empire had changed so dramatically in geography, ethnicity, religion, and culture that it would have been virtually unrecognizable to Augustus. But in one way it remained faithful to his vision: it survived, no matter the cost. In the imperial era Roman women--mothers, wives, mistresses--had substantial authority and influence over the emperors, and Strauss profiles the most important among them, from Livia, Augustus's wife, to Helena, Constantine's mother. But even women in the imperial family often found themselves forced by their emperors to marry or divorce for purely political reasons, and at times they faced exile or even murder. Rome laid the foundations of the West, and its legacy still shapes us today in so many ways, from language, law, and architecture to the seat of the Roman Catholic Church. Strauss examines this enduring heritage through the lives of the men who made it: Augustus, Tiberius, Nero, Vespasian, Trajan, Hadrian, Marcus Aurelius, Septimius Severus, Diocletian, and Constantine. In time they learned to maintain the family business--the government of an empire--by adapting when necessary and always persevering. [This book] is essential history as well as fascinating biography--Dust jacket.||xi, 410 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations, maps ; 24 cm||937.06|BOOK - Book|2019.|2019-03-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781451668834?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G8PxzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Beckwith|Scythians History., Nomads Asia, Central History., Civilization, Ancient., Asia, Central Civilization.|History|In the late 8th to early 7th century BC, Scythian steppe warriors conquered Central Eurasia and peripheral regions in Iran and China, revolutionizing the local cultures. A nomadic herding people who lived with their cats in felt-tent homes on wheels, the Scythians spread their complex, mobile, highly innovative culture into the frontiers of Southeast Europe, the Near East, Central Asia, South Asia, and East Asia. They produced the world's first global civilization: the great cultural flowering known as the Classical Age. In this book, Christopher Beckwith, one of the leading scholars of Central Eurasia, provides a new account of this fascinating culture, their empires, and their influence. He covers their tightly interwoven religious-social economic-political system, their heavenly royal lineage and language, their strikingly elegant new clothing fashions, and their revolutionary thought: Scythian philosophy. Politically, in the west the Scythians founded the sedentary world's first true empire, based in Media (northwestern Iran), which eventually became the Persian Empire. In the east their realm based in Chao (straddling the frontier with northern Chinese culture) introduced the key concepts that led to formation of Chinese national identity and the Chinese Empire. With the Scythian source of these tremendous changes as its focus, the book solves several mysteries surrounding the Scythians and presents some of the greatest true stories of Antiquity in a new light--Provided by publisher.|Paperback edition with ISBN 9780691240558 published by Princeton University Press in [2024].|xxxii, 377 pages : illustrations, maps ; 25 cm||939.51|BOOK - Book|[2023]|2023-01-17|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780691240534?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vex8EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Most of them have won the Nobel Prize. All of them have had lasting impact on both the development of the discipline and how public policy has been and continues to be shaped. But Dr. Yueh goes a step further: In accessible and clear prose, she will explain the impact their respective research has on combating today's great economic problems. For example, she will ask: Milton Friedman, are central banks doing too much? Friedrich Hayek, can financial crashes be prevented? Douglass North, why are so few countries rich? After years of experience providing economic literacy to the public through podcasts, documentaries, lectures, and television programs, Dr. Yueh will bring that wealth of expertise to the page in her first trade book for a general reader. The Great Economists offers a concise history of modern economics, the trailblazing men and women who developed the field, and, more fundamentally, how their findings would solve everything from global inequality to what drives innovation.

His journey into this netherworld included intense and lengthy personal interactions with the famous (such as Bernie Madoff, executives from Enron, Worldcom, Tyco, and McKinsey) as well as those who are lesser known--all of whom traded places of privilege for prison and disgrace. Based on intimate details from personal visits, interviews, letters and phone calls and fascinating psychological, sociological and historical insight, Why They Do It is a breakthrough look at a modern phenomenon. Soltes pushes beyond the explanation that these criminals were driven by psychological aberration, overconfidence, or excessive greed and ambition. Nor did they rationally calculate the costs and benefits of their crimes. Instead, these people were working in a grey zone--Stepping over the line, often without careful calculation, letting their intuition and gut feel for what is right and wrong elude them. Based on innovative research and extended contact with close to 50 former executives--many of whom have never spoken about their crimes--Soltes provides insights such as why some saw the immediate effects of misconduct as positive; why executives often don't feel the emotions--angst, guilt, shame--most people would expect; and how acceptable norms in the business community can differ from those of the broader society. No one book has provided a complete picture of this phenomenon of the white-collar criminal.

Allen describes ancient Cynicism as an improvised philosophy and a way of life disposed to scandalize contemporaries, subjecting their cultural commitments to derision. He chronicles the subsequent purification of Cynicism by the Stoics; Renaissance and Enlightenment appropriations of Cynicism, drawing on the writings of Shakespeare, Rabelais, Rousseau, de Sade, and others; and the transition from Cynicism (the philosophy) to cynicism (the modern attitude), exploring contemporary cynicism from the perspectives of its leftist, liberal, and conservative critics. Finally, he considers the possibility of a radical cynicism that admits and affirms the danger it poses to contemporary society--Source of summary not indicated.||262 pages ; 18 cm.||183.4|BOOK - Book|[2020]|2020-05-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780262537889?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qVzbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Drawing on his extensive knowledge of the historical context in which Jesus operated, Witherington brings these men and women out of the shadows and into the light of day.||xii,123 pages : map ; 23 cm||225.922|BOOK - Book|[2020]|2020-08-31|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781532698255?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=s3D8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

'King' reveals a minister wrestling with his own human frailties and dark moods, a citizen hunted by his own government, and a man determined to fight for justice even if it proved to be a fight to the death. As he follows MLK from the classroom to the pulpit to the streets of Birmingham, Selma, and Memphis, Eig dramatically re-creates the journey of a man who recast American race relations and became the nation's only modern-day founding father - as well as its most mourned martyr. Eig gives as an MLK for our times: a deep thinker, a brilliant strategist, and a committed radical who led one of history's greatest movements, and whose demands for racial and economic justice remain as urgent today as they were in his lifetime--Publisher's description.||x, 669 pages, 8 unnumbered leaves of plates : illustrations ; 24 cm||323.092|BOOK - Book|2023.|2023|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781471181009?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6QK-zQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Three decades later, Jim Sciutto said on CNN's air as the Ukraine war began, that we are living in a 1939 moment. History never ended-it barely paused-and the global order as we have known it is now gone. Great powers are reinvigorated and determined to assert dominance on the world stage. And as it escalates, this new order will affect everyone across the globe. Peace has been shattered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but in reality, this affects every corner of our world-from Helsinki to Beijing, from Australia to the North Pole. This is a battle with many fronts: on the Arctic floor, in the oceans and across the skies, and in cyberspace. Sciutto argues that we are witnessing the return of great power conflict, a definitive break between the post-Cold War era and an entirely new and uncertain one. The world order that marked the last thirty years is shifting, and Sciutto details the realities of this new post-post-Cold War era, the increasingly aligned Russian and Chinese governments, and the flashpoint of a new, global nuclear arms race. With savvy, thorough reporting, he follows-up his 2019 bestseller, The Shadow War: Inside Russia's and China's Secret Operations to Defeat America, which focused on the covert tactics of a hidden conflict. The Return of Great Powers is an analysis of a historic and visible shift in real time. And it poses a question: that as we consider uncertain outcomes, we ask whether the West and Russia and China can prevent a new World War-- Provided by publisher.||xiv, 353 pages ; 24 cm||327.47|BOOK - Book|[2024]|2024-03-12|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593474136?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=37_OEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

There they took 26 hostages, including embassy staff, visitors, and three British citizens. A tense six-day siege ensued as millions gathered around screens across the country to witness the longest news flash in British television history, in which police negotiators and psychiatrists sought a bloodless end to the standoff, while the SAS - hitherto an organisation shrouded in secrecy - laid plans for a daring rescue mission: Operation Nimrod. Drawing on unpublished source material, exclusive interviews with the SAS, and testimony from witnesses including hostages, negotiators, intelligence officers and the on-site psychiatrist, bestselling historian Ben Macintyre takes readers on a gripping journey from the years and weeks of build-up on both sides, to the minute-by-minute account of the siege and rescue. Recreating the dramatic conversations between negotiators and hostages, the cutting-edge intelligence work happening behind-the-scenes, and the media frenzy around this moment of international significance, The Siege is the remarkable story of what really happened on those fateful six days, and the first full account of a moment that forever changed the way the nation thought about the SAS - and itself--Amazon.||xxii, 376 pages, 32 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations (some colour), maps ; 24 cm||356.167|BOOK - Book|2024.|2024-09-12|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780241675670?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d3W00AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Focusing on the lives and achievements of the Sultans themselves, this history mixes court intrigue, wars and plotting against a backdrop of growing power and wealth. Jem Duducu charts the rise and fall of the dynasty, from the forgotten Sultan Murad IV who led soldiers into battle, captured Baghdad and banned alcohol but died young from drink, to the most famous rulers such as Suleiman the Magnificent. The account includes worldchanging events such as the fall of Constantinople. It describes the strong trade alliances the empire had with Elizabeth I, and demystifies the Sultan's harem. In modern times it traces the outbreak of war in 1914 as the Ottoman hold on power fractured, and describes the bloody fighting with Allied troops at Gallipoli. The Sultans explains how the Republic of Turkey is not the same thing as the Ottoman Empire, but remains in its historical shadow, as part of an Islamic world torn by religious conflict and power struggles.||306 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates : Illustrations (some colour), maps, portraits ; 24 cm||956.101|BOOK - Book|2018.|2018|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781445668604?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7jYjnQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Until the middle of the nineteenth century, the city that is now Tokyo was a sprawling fishing town by the bay named Edo. Earlier still, in the Middle Ages, it was Edojuku, an outpost overlooking farmlands. And thousands of years ago, its mudflats and marshes were home to elephants, deer, and marine life. In this compact history, Jonathan Clements traces Tokyo's fascinating story from the first forest clearances and the samurai wars to the hedonistic floating world of the last years of the Shogunate. He illuminates the Tokyo of the twentieth century with its destruction and redevelopment, boom and bust without forgoing the thousand years of history that have led to the Eastern Capital as we know it. Tokyo is so entwined with the history of Japan that it can be hard to separate them, and A Short History of Tokyo tells both the story of the city itself and offers insight into Tokyo's position at the nexus of power and people that has made the city crucial to the events of the whole country.|First published in 2018 as An armchair traveller's history of Tokyo.|170 pages ; 20 cm||952.135|BOOK - Book|2020.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781912208975?s=MD|

And why we see the rise of nationalism everywhere when globalization, on average, has made us all richer. The disconnect between our experience of the world and the economic model used to explain it has given rise to angrynomics: an economy of heightened uncertainty and anger, where faith in the workings of markets and politics has been undermined and rapid and seemingly ever-accelerating economic change has become something to be feared.0Eric Lonergan and Mark Blyth have written a book for anyone anxious, worried - or angry - about the mismatch between how they experience the world with the increasing day to day pressures they face and the model used by economic elites and politicians to explain and justify it.

To look south from Central Park these days is to gaze upon a physical manifestation of tens of billions of dollars in global wealth: a series of soaring spires dotting the skyline from Park Avenue to Broadway. Known as Billionaires' Row, these slender high-rise condos have transformed the skyline of New York City almost in stealth, thanks to the city's developer-friendly policies and a seemingly endless gush of cash from tech, finance, and moguls from Russia, China, and the Middle East. In just a few years, the cutthroat real estate impresarios behind these supertalls turned what was once a rundown strip of Midtown into the most expensive street on Earth. Most of us, however, will never be invited inside these gargantuan towers. The saga of Billionaires' Row epitomizes the new Gilded Age of twenty-first-century wealth. Behind the blue-tinted facÌ§ade of One57, you might see financier Bill Ackman riding in an elevator to his $91.5 million apartment with computer legend Michael Dell, who paid $100.47 million for his. One block over, hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin shattered records with his $238 million home at 220 Central Park South, the imposing limestone tower where the musician Sting also purchased a penthouse of his own. Most owners, however, remain shrouded in mystery. For some, these monuments to wealth are a place simply to park money; they have never bothered to visit. In Billionaires' Row, Wall Street Journal reporter Katherine Clarke reveals the riveting inside story of how a group of New York's most legendary developers went toe-to-toe with renegade upstarts in an ego-fueled race to build the tallest and most luxurious skyscrapers the world has ever known-and to burnish their legacies in the process. The result is a real-life drama complete with broken partnerships, broken marriages, lawsuits, and, for a few, triumph--Provided by publisher.||xxx, 379 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations (chiefly colour), map ; 25 cm||333.338|BOOK - Book|[2023]|2023-06-13|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593240069?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=My2OEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

He shows how many of the unhelpful ways we have come to think about time are actually choices we have made -- and that we could do things differently   --Provided by publisher., There's a good reason why everyone has been talking about Oliver Burkeman's New York Times bestseller, Four Thousand Weeks. Nobody needs to be told there isn't enough time. Whether we're starting our own business, or trying to write a novel during our lunch break, or staring down a pile of deadlines as we're planning a vacation, we're obsessed with our lengthening to-do lists, overfilled inboxes, work-life balance, and ceaseless struggle against distraction. We're deluged with advice on becoming more productive and efficient and life hacks to optimize our days. But such techniques often end up making things worse. The sense of anxious hurry grows more intense, and yet the most meaningful parts of life seem to lie just beyond the horizon. Still, we rarely make the connection between our daily struggles with time and the ultimate time management problem : the challenge of how best to use our four thousand weeks, the average length of a human life.    Drawing on the insights of both ancient and contemporary philosophers, psychologists, and spiritual teachers, Oliver Burkeman delivers an entertaining, humorous, practical, and ultimately profound guide to time and time management. Rejecting the futile modern obsession with getting everything done, Four Thousand Weeks introduces readers to tools for constructing a meaningful life by embracing finitude, showing that many of the unhelpful ways we've come to think about time aren't inescapable, unchanging truths, but choices we've made as individuals and as a society -- and that we can do things differently   -- Provided by publisher.||x, 287 pages ; 21 cm||650.11|BOOK - Book|2023.|2023-06-27|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781250849359?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l4tVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Albert Einstein did nothing of note on May 29, 1919, yet that is when he became immortal. On that day, astronomer Arthur Eddington and his team observed a solar eclipse and found something extraordinary: gravity bends light, just as Einstein predicted. The findings confirmed the theory of general relativity, fundamentally changing our understanding of space and time. A century later, another group of astronomers is performing a similar experiment on a much larger scale. The Event Horizon Telescope, a globe-spanning array of radio dishes, is examining space surrounding Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. As Ron Cowen recounts, one foremost goal of the experiment is to determine whether Einstein was right on the details. Gravity lies at the heart of what we don't know about quantum mechanics, but tantalizing possibilities for deeper insight are offered by black holes. By observing starlight wrapping around Sagittarius A*, the telescope will not only provide the first direct view of an event horizon--a black hole's point of no return--but will also enable scientists to test Einstein's theory under the most extreme conditions. Gravity's Century shows how we got from the pivotal observations of the 1919 eclipse to the Event Horizon Telescope, and what is at stake today. Breaking down the physics in clear and approachable language, Cowen makes vivid how the quest to understand gravity is really the quest to comprehend the universe--Provided by publisher.||viii, 181 pages : illustrations ; 22 cm||530.11|BOOK - Book|2019.|2019-05-06|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780674974968?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZnSPDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In Killing The Killers, #1 bestselling authors Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard take readers deep inside the global war on terror, which began twenty years ago on September 11, 2001. As the World Trade Center buildings collapsed, the Pentagon burned, and a small group of passengers fought desperately to stop a third plane from completing its deadly flight plan, America went on war footing. Killing The Killers narrates America's intense global war against extremists who planned and executed not only the 9/11 attacks, but hundreds of others in America and around the world, and who eventually destroyed entire nations in their relentless quest for power. Killing The Killers moves from Afghanistan to Iraq, Iran to Yemen, Syria, and Libya, and elsewhere, as the United States fought Al Qaeda, ISIS, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, as well as individually targeting the most notorious leaders of these groups. With fresh detail and deeply-sourced information, O'Reilly and Dugard create an unstoppable account of the most important war of our era. Killing The Killers is the most thrilling and suspenseful book in the #1 bestselling series of popular history books (over 18 million sold) in the world-- Provided by publisher.|Includes index.|275 pages : illustrations, maps, portraits ; 25 cm||363.325|BOOK - Book|2022.|2022-05-03|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781250279255?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EWM1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

I was in 'the void, she writes, a vast emptiness that fills your heart and lungs and restricts your ability to think or even breathe. Her friend Adam Grant, a psychologist at Wharton, told her there are concrete steps people can take to recover and rebound from life-shattering experiences. We are not born with a fixed amount of resilience. It is a muscle that everyone can build. Option B combines Sheryl's personal insights with Adam's research on finding strength in the face of adversity. Beginning with the gut-wrenching moment when she finds her husband, Dave Goldberg, collapsed on a gym floor, Sheryl opens up her heart -- and her journal--to describe the acute grief and isolation she felt in the wake of his death. But Option B goes beyond Sheryl's loss to explore how a broad range of people have overcome hardships including illness, job loss, sexual assault, natural disasters, and the violence of war. Their stories reveal the capacity of the human spirit to persevere and to rediscover joy. Resilience comes from deep within us and from support outside us. Even after the most devastating events, it is possible to grow by finding deeper meaning and gaining greater appreciation in our lives. Option B illuminates how to help others in crisis, develop compassion for ourselves, raise strong children, and create resilient families, communities, and workplaces. Many of these lessons can be applied to everyday struggles, allowing us to brave whatever lies ahead.

This book teaches the basics of writing cryptographic algorithms in Python, demystifies cryptographic internals, and demonstrates common ways cryptography is used incorrectly. Cryptography is the life blood of the digital worlds security infrastructure. From governments around the world to the average consumer, most communications are protected in some form or another by cryptography. These days, even Google searches are encrypted. Despite its ubiquity, cryptography is easy to misconfigure, misuse, and misunderstand. Developers building cryptographic operations into their applications are not typically experts in the subject, and may not fully grasp the implication of different algorithms, modes, and other parameters. The concepts in this book are largely taught by example, including incorrect uses of cryptography and how bad cryptography can be broken. By digging into the guts of cryptography, you can experience what works, what doesn't, and why. What Youll Learn: Understand where cryptography is used, why, and how it gets misused Know what secure hashing is used for and its basic properties Get up to speed on algorithms and modes for block ciphers such as AES, and see how bad configurations break Use message integrity and/or digital signatures to protect messages Utilize modern symmetric ciphers such as AES-GCM and CHACHA Practice the basics of public key cryptography, including ECDSA signatures Discover how RSA encryption can be broken if insecure padding is used Employ TLS connections for secure communications.

Rooted, Resilient, and Ready explores how today's teen girl assembles her identity through the interweaving of genetics, family, and friends, and the masks she may feel she needs to wear to be accepted. The book counters the negative cultural messages and potential for disordered eating that affect a teen's body image and guides parents through Lindsay Sealey's three-part approach to a happier, healthier teen: food, fitness, fun. Balancing research with practical advice and interviews, Sealey encourages parents to nurture the process of their teen's development and guide their teen girls even though they may often feel out of step with them. Journeying with teen girls from lost and let-down to fierce and fearless, Rooted, Resilient, and Ready gives parents the tools to prepare their daughters to step into their power and potential, choosing progress over perfection, security over uncertainty, happiness over self-pity, and authenticity over conformity.||273 pages ; 23 cm.||649.133|BOOK - Book|2020.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781928055440?s=MD|

For most of human history, and in almost all the world's cultures, nature was believed to be sacred, and our God or gods to be present everywhere in the natural world. When people in the West began to separate God and nature in modern times, it was not just a profound breach with thousands of years of accumulated wisdom: it also set in train the destruction of the natural world. Taking themes that have been central to the world's religious traditions -- from gratitude and compassion to sacrifice and non-violence -- Armstrong offers practical steps to help us develop a new mindset to reconnect with nature and rekindle our sense of the sacred. Sacred Nature reveals the most profound connections between humans and the natural world. It speaks to anyone interested in our relationship with nature, worried about the destruction of our environment, and searching for new ways of thinking to shape the action needed to save our planet--Publisher's description.||239 pages ; 22 cm||202.12|BOOK - Book|2022.|2022-06-30|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781847926883?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F6SYzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Unlike the previous major Arab-Israeli war of 1967, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) faced an enemy that had invested heavily in modern Soviet weapon systems and tactics.Using detailed colour artwork and insightful analysis, this book explains how the effective use of the Soviet-supplied AT-3 Sagger (9M14 Malyutka) anti-tank missile allowed small Arab tank-killing teams to destroy Israeli armor at an astonishing rate. It also analyses the tank that opposed it, the US-built M60A1, which had to fight for survival against the Arab Saggers, and shows how in both the Sinai and the Golan Heights, the IDF quickly learned that firepower and infantry/artillery cooperation were the keys to their survival.||80 pages : illustrations (some color) ; 25 cm||956.048|BOOK - Book|2018.|2018-01-23|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781472825773?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T-48DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

But far more significant than the songs he has penned is the source of his inspiration--the creativity embodied in Jesus Christ, the incarnate Word of God. In this book Card explores the biblical foundations of true Christian creativity. Whether we think of ourselves as creative or not, all of us are created in the image of our Creator God, and thus creativity is a vital expression of our discipleship. With Jesus as his model, Card shows how understanding God's creative imagination leads to a lifestyle of humility, obedience and servanthood. And he invites us to follow God's creative call through worship and community. Through Jesus, God has spoken to us in a word we can understand. Likewise, Michael Card has articulated the story of Jesus to others through his own scribblings in the sand. This book shows us how we can do the same.||166 pages ; 22 cm.||233.5|BOOK - Book|2022.|2022-06-07|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780830847037?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5G-b0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Shinrin-yoku or forest bathing is the practice of spending time in the forest for better health, happiness and a sense of calm. A pillar of Japanese culture for decades, Shinrin-yoku is a way to reconnect with nature, it can include anything from walking mindfully in the woods, to take a break in your local park, from drinking bark tea, to walking barefoot on your lawn. In a time when more than 75 per cent of the world's population live in urban areas, disconnected from the natural world, Shinrin-yoku is like a bridge that bridges gap between ourselves and natureThis book brings together years of cutting edge research from the world expert on Forest Medicine, Dr Qing Li, with practical tips and anecdotes of the life-changing power of Shinrin-yoku. Dr Li's research has proven that spending time around trees (even filling your home with house plants and burning essential tree oils) can reduce blood pressure, lower stress, lower blood sugar levels, boost energy, improve concentration, boost immune system and even help you to lose weight--Publisher's description.||300 pages : color illustrations, color maps ; 22 cm||615.851|BOOK - Book|2018.|2018-04-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780241346952?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r1mKtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Have you been frustrated by unsuccessful interactions with non-native English speakers? Did you know there is a simple solution to improve cross-cultural communication in English? What most of us native speakers overlook in these situations is that the problem here may not be the limited English of the other person; it could be our English. And while we certainly can't do anything about the former, we can do a great deal about the latter. In just 160 pages, this book gives 50 practical tools to help you become aware of and adapt your own language to completely transform exchanges with limited-English speakers and greatly increase the chances of a satisfying outcome for native speakers and for the limited-English speakers they're trying to serve. And the good news is: it is not that difficult and it is entirely in the hands of the native speaker. Craig Storti is a nationally known figure with over 30 years of experience in the field of intercultural communications and cross-cultural adaptation, and the author of several standard works, including Culture Matters, a cross-cultural workbook used by the U. S. government in over 90 countries. He has successfully led workshops on cultural diversity for Fortune 500 companies, hotels such as Marriott, diplomats, civil servants, and foreign aid workers. But it was his 90-minute segments on common mistakes native speakers make when talking to limited-English speakers and how participants could improve interactions that became the most popular and useful aspect of his training. This much-needed book is ideal for anyone working in a public facing job from government to hospitality, international organizations, human resources, cross-cultural and diversity training, English teaching, foreign aid, or those with a love of language, culture and communication--Publisher's description.||xviii, 188 pages ; 20 cm||401.4|BOOK - Book|2022.|2022-09-06|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781529396881?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WdfazgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. Other animals have stronger muscles or sharper claws, but we have cleverer brains. If machine brains one day come to surpass human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become very powerful. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on us humans than on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our species then would come to depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence. But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation? To get closer to an answer to this question, we must make our way through a fascinating landscape of topics and considerations. Read the book and learn about oracles, genies, singletons; about boxing methods, tripwires, and mind crime; about humanity's cosmic endowment and differential technological development; indirect normativity, instrumental convergence, whole brain emulation and technology couplings; Malthusian economics and dystopian evolution; artificial intelligence, and biological cognitive enhancement, and collective intelligence. -- Source other than Library of Congress.|With new afterword (pages 321-324).|xvi, 415 pages : illustrations ; 20 cm||006.301|BOOK - Book|2016.|2016-04-14|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780198739838?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i0QdjgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Packed with extraordinarily helpful insights and inspiring true stories, [this book] illustrates how to thrive in later life (even if coping with a chronic medical condition), how to get the best from our health care system, and how to make your own 'good death' more likely. This handbook of step-by-step preparations--practical, communal, physical, and sometimes spiritual--will help you make the most of your remaining time, be it decades, years, or months. Award-winning science journalist Katy Butler, an authority on end-of-life issues, explains how to successfully age in place, how to pick and have honest conversations with a younger doctor, when not to call 911, and how to make your death a sacred rite of passage rather than a medical event. A down-to-earth manual for living, aging, and dying with meaning and even joy, [this book] is based on Butler's own experience caring for aging parents, as well as hundreds of conversations with people who have successfully navigated a fragmented health system and helped their loved ones achieve good deaths. It also draws on interviews with nationally recognized experts in family medicine, palliative care, geriatrics, oncology, hospice, and other medical specialties. Inspired by the medieval death manual Ars Moriendi, or the 'Art of Dying,' [this book] is the definitive update for our modern age and illuminates the path to a better end of life--Dust jacket.||xi, 274 pages : illustrations, map ; 24 cm||155.937|BOOK - Book|2019.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781501135316?s=MD|

For generations, our remote ancestors have been cast as primitive and childlike--either free and equal innocents, or thuggish and warlike. Civilization, we are told, could be achieved only by sacrificing those original freedoms or, alternatively, by taming our baser instincts. David Graeber and David Wengrow show how such theories first emerged in the eighteenth century as a conservative reaction to powerful critiques of European society posed by Indigenous observers and intellectuals. Revisiting this encounter has startling implications for how we make sense of human history today, including the origins of farming, property, cities, democracy, slavery, and civilization itself. Drawing on pathbreaking research in archaeology and anthropology, the authors show how history becomes a far more interesting place once we learn to throw off our conceptual shackles and perceive what's really there. If humans did not spend 95 percent of their evolutionary past in tiny bands of hunter-gatherers, what were they doing all that time? If agriculture, and cities, did not mean a plunge into hierarchy and domination, then what kinds of social and economic organization did they lead to? The answers are often unexpected, and suggest that the course of human history may be less set in stone, and more full of playful, hopeful possibilities, than we tend to assume. The Dawn of Everything fundamentally transforms our understanding of the human past and offers a path toward imagining new forms of freedom, new ways of organizing society--Provided by publisher.|Originally published in 2021 by Allen Lane, Great Britain--Title page verso.|xii, 692 pages : illustrations, maps ; 24 cm||901|BOOK - Book|2021|2021-11-09|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780374157357?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4zUmEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

He reveals how emotionally-charged events from your past can still be haunting you in the form of 'trapped emotions' - emotional energies that literally inhabit your body. These trapped emotions can fester in your life and body, creating pain, malfunction and eventual disease. They can also extract a heavy mental and emotional toll on you, impacting how you think, the choices that you make, and the level of success and abundance you are able to achieve. Perhaps most damaging of all, trapped emotional energies can gather around your heart, cutting off your ability to give and receive love. The Emotion Code is a powerful and simple way to rid yourself of this unseen baggage. Dr. Nelson's method gives you the tools to identify and release the trapped emotions in your life, eliminating your 'emotional baggage', and opening your heart and body to the positive energies of the world.

Many manuals on pastel painting take for granted the use of traditional soft pastels, a dry medium that provides the richness and variety of paint colours. Soft pastel is certainly the most versatile and widely used, but the modern range of materials include other pastel types that have their own specific purpose. In this exhaustive A-Z reference for artists of all skills, a variety of different pastel types are detailed, from oil through to water-soluble pastels, amongst the multitude of techniques broken down and easily explained. The book itself is divided into two sections: the first provides step-by-step demonstrations that guide artists through a variety of techniques, from basic colour mixing through to creating special effects such as sgraffito and sfumato. The second part focuses on themes, illustrating how individual artists tackle a number of subjects, including natural landscapes, urban scenes, figures, animals and still life.

The Little Black Book of Decision Making delves into the cognition behind decision making, guiding you through the different ways your mind approaches various scenarios. You'll learn to notice that decision making is a matter of balance between your rational side and your intuition - the trick is in honing your intuition to steer you down the right path. Pure reasoning cannot provide all of the answers, and relying solely on intuition could prove catastrophic in business. There must be a balance between the two, and the proportions may change with each situation. This book helps you quickly pinpoint the right mix of logic and 'gut feeling,' and use it to find the best possible solution.

Sanuk is a Thai concept that can loosely be translated as meaning 'fun'. Though sanuk is in fact much more than that; it's about achieving pleasure and joy in all aspects of life. For Thai people, if it's not sanuk, it's not worth doing. Thai people believe that it's the little things that add up to a joyful life. Whether it's raising happy kids, enjoying a quick chat with your neighbour or having a laugh with friends, they try to bring a sense of joy into their daily routines. This easygoing, fun-loving way of life is why Thailand is often called The Land of Smiles. But how can we learn to prioritise this sense of fun and pleasure in our own lives? With recent clinical studies showing a clear link between a person's outlook on life and their health, a mindset of optimism and positivity has obvious benefits. Being a glass half full kind of person doesn't just help us live longer, it helps us live better. Embracing sanuk and approaching life a glass-half-full attitude can make you happier, healthier and more productive - and this book will show you how--Publisher's website.||272 pages : colour illustrations ; 19 cm||158|BOOK - Book|2024.|2024-06-06|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008657819?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uJ0M0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Explains how to activate the body's regenerative abilities and combat inflammation through diet, supplements, detox, herbs, exercise, energy medicine, and mindfulness. Examines the science of epigenetics and the potential of stem cell therapies for regeneration of joints and organs as well as for healing the telomeres of our DNA. Reveals the importance of hormone balance and sleep as a core regenerative therapy Harnessing the advances of the new paradigm of medicine--which focuses on the regenerative abilities of the body rather than symptom management--Elisa Lottor, Ph. D., HMD, explains how each of us can turn on the body's self-healing abilities, prevent illness before it starts, and reverse the aging process to live longer, healthier, and happier lives. Beginning with a focus on the foods we eat, the author reveals how many diseases and symptoms of aging are the result of inflammation in the body, caused by poor diet and a lack of crucial nutrients. She explains the top foods to avoid, such as refined sugar, and the best nutrient-rich foods to include, along with easy and delicious recipes. Showing how regenerative medicine treats the roots of aging and disease, preventing them before they start, she details the regenerative properties of the liver complex, explaining the best ways to detox, and reveals how to restore optimal microbe balance in your gut. Dr. Lottor explores the regenerative properties of adaptogens, herbs, and nutriceuticals, the unobtrusive healing practices of energy medicine, the importance of hormone balance, and the concept of living water. She also underscores sleep as a core regenerative therapy. Looking at the most cutting-edge research in the rapidly emerging field of regenerative medicine, Dr. Lottor examines the potential of stem cell therapies for regeneration of joints and organs as well as for lengthening our DNA's telomeres, the shrinkage of which is now considered a chief cause of aging. She also looks at the science of gene expression--epigenetics--and how DNA can be used as both a health predictor and a tool for preventing inherited diseases. Including a comprehensive resource section for finding products and practitioners, Dr. Lottor offers each of us the necessary tools and information to reverse aging and participate in your own wellness--Provided by publisher., Turn on the body's self-healing abilities, prevent illness before it starts, and reverse the aging process--Provided by publisher.||xi, 308 pages ; 23 cm||613.2|BOOK - Book|[2017]|2017-12-12|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781620556030?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0OXKAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

It allows the serious or curious yogi to better understand how yoga provides myriad benefits for the body and mind. It also encourages readers to engage in critical thinking when evaluating claims about what yoga can do. Chapters cover the musculoskeletal, nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular, lymphatic, immune, endocrine, reproductive, and digestive systems of the body. A final chapter provides practical application with four sample yoga practices-- Provided by publisher., While many people practice yoga simply because it helps them feel good, the physiological basis for yoga's effects on the body and mind is often unknown or misunderstood. Understanding these physiological concepts can help to deepen your yoga practice.The Physiology of Yoga separates speculation from fact by examining how the body responds and adapts to yoga within many systems of the body: musculoskeletal, nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular, lymphatic, immune, endocrine, reproductive, and digestive. Straightforward explanations guide you in sorting through conflicting information about what yoga really can help you achieve and in evaluating whether certain yoga methods provide benefits to any or all of those systems.You can experiment with concepts through Try It Yourself sidebars, which focus on mindful movement, meditation, and breathing. The 14 Myth or Fact sidebars explore popular claims about yoga, such as whether a shoulder stand can stimulate the thyroid or if twists can detoxify the liver. You'll get the most current research to determine the validity of various claims so you can avoid practices that could be harmful or counterproductive and can decide for yourself what works for your practice.Finally, experience firsthand how yoga affects your physiology by exploring specific yoga poses and four sequences. Each sequence explains which of the physiological principles from the earlier chapters may be most prevalent in that sequence.With The Physiology of Yoga, you or your students can navigate all the conflicting views and opinions about the impact of yoga and learn to practice yoga while fully enjoying the benefits of mindful movement.CE exam available! For certified professionals, a companion continuing education exam can be completed after reading this book.

Stories mould who we are, from our character to our cultural identity. They drive us to act out our dreams and ambitions, and shape our politics and beliefs. We use them to construct our relationships, to keep order in our law courts, to interpret events in our newspapers and social media. Storytelling is an essential part of what makes us human. There have been many attempts to understand what makes a good story from Joseph Campbell's well-worn theories about myth and archetype to recent attempts to crack the 'Bestseller Code'. But few have used a scientific approach. This is curious, for if we are to truly understand storytelling in its grandest sense, we must first come to understand the ultimate storyteller the human brain. In this scalpel-sharp, thought-provoking book, Will Storr demonstrates how master storytellers manipulate and compel us, leading us on a journey from the Hebrew scriptures to Mr Men, from Booker Prize-winning literature to box set TV. Applying dazzling psychological research and cutting-edge neuroscience to the foundations of our myths and archetypes, he shows how we can use these tools to tell better stories - and make sense of our chaotic modern world.||272 pages ; 21 cm||808.3|BOOK - Book|2019.|2019|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008276935?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ej7HugEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

She talks about her identity as the child of an immigrant, her feelings about being in a mixed-race marriage, her opinions on mental health. But as her stories progress, it becomes clear a volatile secret lurks beneath their surface. There are events in Hui's past that have great significance for the person she's become, but that have gone missing from her memory. What is it, exactly, that is haunting Hui? Who is the little girl she talks to? And who, actually, is Hui herself? As the conversation continues, what unfolds is a breathtaking, unexpected journey through layers of story toward truth and recovered identity; a memoir that reenacts, in tautly novelistic fashion, the process of healing that author Shze-Hui Tjoa moved through in order to recover memories lost to complex ptsd and, eventually, reconstruct her sense of self.

And yet, a decade ago, the same bank was hit with a record US fine of $1.9 billion for facilitating money laundering for 'drug kingpins and rogue nations'. Between 2003 to 2010 HSBC allowed El Chapo and the Sinaloa cartel, one of the most notorious and murderous criminal organizations in the world, to turn its ill-gotten money into clean dollars.

This is an extraordinary story that starts in Hong Kong and ranges across London, Washington, the Cayman Islands and Mexico -- where HSBC saw the opportunity to become the largest bank in the world. It brings together an extraordinary cast of politicians, bankers, drug dealers, FBI officers and whistle-blowers, and asks what price does greed have? Whose job is it to police global finance? And why did not a single person go to prison for facilitating the murderous expansion of a global drug empire?||viii, 312 pages ; 24 cm||364.168|BOOK - Book|2022.|2022-06|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781529065046?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YpWbzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The key to being a successful trader is finding a system that works and sticking with it. Author Al Brooks has done just that. By simplifying his trading system and trading only 5-minute price charts he's found a way to capture profits regardless of market direction or economic climate. His first book, Reading Price Charts Bar by Bar, offered an informative examination of his system, but it didn't allow him to get into the real nuts and bolts of the approach. Now, with this new series of books, Brooks takes you step by step through the entire process. By breaking down his trading system into its simplest pieces: institutional piggybacking or trend trading (the topic of this particular book in the series), trading ranges, and transitions or reversals, this three book series offers access to Brooks' successful methodology. Price Action Trends Bar by Bar describes in detail what individual bars and combinations of bars can tell a trader about what institutions are doing. This is critical because the key to making money in trading is to piggyback institutions and you cannot do that unless you understand what the charts are telling you about their behavior. This book will allow you to see what type of trend is unfolding, so can use techniques that are specific to that type of trend to place the right trades. Discusses how to profit from institutional trading trends using technical analysis Outlines a detailed and original trading approach developed over the author's successful career as an independent trader Other books in the series include Price Action Trading Ranges Bar by Bar and Price Action Reversals Bar by Bar. If you're looking to make the most of your time in today's markets the trading insights found in Price Action Trends Bar by Bar will help you achieve this goal--|The first edition of this book titled, Reading price charts bar by bar : the technical analysis of price action for the serious trader, was published in 2009--T.p. verso., Includes index.|xxvii, 447 pages: illustrations; 25 cm.||332.632|BOOK - Book|2012.|2011-11-29|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781118066515?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KVpE9BbrOZAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

But how did it all start? In September 1953, 22-year-old Rupert Murdoch landed in Adelaide, South Australia. Fresh from Oxford with a radical reputation, the young and brash son of Sir Keith Murdoch had arrived to fulfill his father's dying wish: for Rupert to live a 'useful altruistic and full life' in the media. For decades, Sir Keith had been a giant of the Australian press, but his final years were spent bitterly fending off rivals and would-be successors. When the dust settled on his father's estate, Rupert was left with the Adelaide-based News Ltd and its afternoon paper The News -- a minor player in a small, parochial city. But even this inheritance was soon under siege, as the left-wing 'Boy Publisher' stared down his father's old colleagues at the city's paper of record, The Advertiser, and a conservative establishment kept in power by a decades-old gerrymander. Led by Rupert's friend, ally, and editor-in-chief Rohan Rivett, the fledgling Murdoch press began a seven-year campaign of circulation wars, expansion, and courtroom battles that divided the city and would lay the foundations for a global empire -- if Rupert and Rohan didn't end up in custody first. Drawing on unpublished archival material and new reportage, Young Rupert pieces together a paper trail of succession, sedition, and power -- and a fascinating time capsule of Australian media on the cusp of an extraordinary ascension.||344 pages ; 24 cm||070.92|BOOK - Book|2023.|2023-11-09|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781915590503?s=MD|

Manual., Stoics., Manual (Epictetus), Conduct of life., Stoics., Self-help publications.||As the Modern Stoicism movement has blossomed over the past decade, its practitioners and enthusiasts have struggled with some of the movement's stranger claims. Should we really be indifferent to death of a loved one, or to our own demise? Is it truly unacceptable to care about one's work? Should we really look to nature for moral guidance? And what role does Providence have in ordering human affairs? In A Field Guide to a Happy Life, philosopher and Stoic Massimo Pigliucci has embarked on an ambitious task: offering his own view how the teachings of the Stoics can be adapted to modern mores and knowledge, taking as his inspiration the classic epitome of ancient Stoicism, Epictetus' Handbook. This is not another translation of Epictetus' teachings. Epictetus's ancient Stoicism, with its emphasis on indifference, can seem to call for us to be soulless automatons. For him, all aspiration was vanity and all grieving wrong-headed. Pigliucci is a modern master of the school, and is offering a major revision of the philosophy. This is not hubris: The ancient Stoics believed that their ideas were meant to be updated by future generations. And so Pigliucci revises or discards the teachings of ancient Stoicism that have come to seem inhumane-arguing that it's fine to want to do well at work or to mourn the loss of a loved-one-or unscientific, while retaining the doctrine's core emphasis on resilience and equanimity. In his hands, Stoicism isn't about cultivating indifference to our social and emotional lives. It's about learning to endure life's hardships without being overwhelmed, while enjoying life's pleasures without losing our heads. The Stoic philosopher Seneca once wrote that those who advanced these doctrines before us are not our masters but our guides. Each Stoic must be their own master. In A Field Guide to a Happy Life, Pigliucci will help them find their way-- Provided by publisher.||viii, 151 pages ; 19 cm||171.2|BOOK - Book|2020.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781541646933?s=MD|

Such events can range from train disasters and car crashes to natural calamities such as earthquakes, wildfires and floods, and from life-threatening medical diagnoses to acts of violence and abuse. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a common psychological condition resulting from such events and occurs when our coping resources have been completely overwhelmed. The intrusive hyper-reactions, recurring memories, flashbacks, avoidance behaviours and changes in the sense of self linger long past the actual event and often prevent a sense of healing or resolution with the experience.

Unlike other coffee books, this one focuses exclusively on coffee, not espresso, and explores multiple pour-over, immersion, and cold-brew techniques on 10 different devices. Thanks to a small but growing number of dedicated farmers, importers, roasters, and baristas, coffee quality is at an all-time high. But for nonprofessionals, achieving cafeÌ quality at home can seem out of reach. With dozens of equipment options, conflicting information on how to use that equipment, and an industry language that, at times, doesn't seem made for the rest of us, it can be difficult to know where to begin. Craft Coffee: A Manual, written by a coffee enthusiast for coffee enthusiasts, is a comprehensive guide to improving your brew at home. The book provides all the information readers need to discover what they like in a cup of specialty coffee and how to replicate the perfect cup day after day. From the science of extraction and brewing techniques to choosing equipment and deciphering coffee bags, Craft Coffee focuses on issues -- cost, time, taste, and accessibility -- that home coffee brewers negotiate, and shows that no matter where you are in your coffee journey, you can make a great cup at home.||272 pages : illustrations ; 20 cm||641.877|BOOK - Book|[2017]|2017|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781572842335?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bo48MQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

When Christian armies seized Jerusalem in 1099, they began the most notorious period of conflict between the two religions. Depending on who you ask, the fall of the holy city was either an inspiring legend or the greatest of horrors. In Crusaders, Dan Jones interrogates the many sides of the larger story, charting a deeply human and avowedly pluralist path through the crusading era. Expanding the usual timeframe, Jones looks to the roots of Christian-Muslim relations in the eighth century and tracks the influence of crusading to present day. He widens the geographical focus to far-flung regions home to so-called enemies of the Church, including Spain, North Africa, southern France, and the Baltic states. By telling intimate stories of individual journeys, Jones illuminates these centuries of war not only from the perspective of popes and kings, but from Arab-Sicilian poets, Byzantine princesses, Sunni scholars, Shi'ite viziers, Mamluk slave soldiers, Mongol chieftains, and barefoot friars. Crusading remains a rallying call to this day, but its role in the popular imagination ignores the cooperation and complicated coexistence that were just as much a feature of the period as warfare. The age-old relationships between faith, conquest, wealth, power, and trade meant that crusading was not only about fighting for the glory of God, but also, among other earthly reasons, about gold. In this richly dramatic narrative that gives voice to sources usually pushed to the margins, Dan Jones has written an authoritative survey of the holy wars with global scope and human focus-- Provided by publisher.|First published in hardcover in Great Britain by Head of Zeus, Ltd London, in 2019--Title page verso.|xxxvii, 425 pages, 16 unnumbered pages of plates : color illustrations, maps ; 26 cm||909.07|BOOK - Book|[2019]|2019|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780525428312?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3EbLwQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Being a journalist, she dove into the research and uncovered neurodiversity-a framework that moves away from pathologizing abnormal versus normal brains and instead recognizes the vast diversity of our mental makeups.

Sharing real stories from women with ADHD, autism, synesthesia, misophonia, and more, Nerenberg explores how these brain variances present differently in women and dispels widely held misconceptions. She also offers a path forward, describing practical changes in how we can communicate, design our surroundings, and better support divergent minds. When we allow our wide variety of brain makeups to flourish, we create a better tomorrow for us all-- Provided by publisher.||pages cm||616.89|BOOK - Book|[2019]|2020-03-24|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062876799?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H_zQxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

With her parents at constant odds, Song learns more words in Korean for hatred than for love. When the family's fake Gucci business lands them in bankruptcy, Song moves to a new elementary school. On her first day, a girl asks the teacher: Can she speak English? Neither rich nor white, Song does what is necessary to be visible: she internalizes the model minority myth as well as her beloved mother's dreams to see her on a secure path. Song meets these expectations by attending the best Ivy League universities in the country. But when she wavers, in search of an artistic life on her own terms, her mother warns, Happiness is what unexceptional people tell themselves when they don't have the talent and drive to go after real success. Years of self-erasure take a toll and Song experiences recurring episodes of depression and mania. A thought repeats: I want to die. I want to die. Song enters a psychiatric hospital where she meets patients with similar struggles. So begins her sweeping journey to heal herself by losing everything. Unflinching and lyrical, Docile is one woman's story of subverting the model minority myth, contending with mental illness, and finding her self-worth by looking within.||294 pages ; 24 cm.||305.895|BOOK - Book|2024.|2024-07-16|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781668003664?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wUAPEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

A.||QurÊ¼an Criticism, interpretation, etc., Islam and philosophy., QurÊ¼an and philosophy., Islam.||The teachings, style and impact of the Qur'an have always been matters of controversy, among both Muslims and non-Muslims. But in a modern context of intercultural sensitivity, what the Qur'an says and means are perhaps more urgent questions than ever before. This major new book by one of the world's finest Islamic scholars responds to that urgency. Building on his earlier groundbreaking work, the author challenges misinterpretations of particular Qur'anic verses from whatever quarter. He addresses the infamous 'sword' verse, frequently cited as a justification for jihad. He also questions the 'tribute' verse, associated with the Muslim state subjugating Jews and Christians; and the idea of Paradise in the Qur'an, often viewed by the West as emphasising merely physical pleasures, or used by Islamic fighters as their just reward for holy war. The author argues that wrenching the verses out of the context of the whole has led to dangerous ideologies being built on isolated phrases which have then assumed afterlives of their own. This nuanced, holistic reading has vital interfaith ramifications.||vii, 352 pages ; 24 cm||297.122|BOOK - Book|2017.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781780763651?s=MD|

In the age of Trump and Brexit, every crisis is instantly overridden by the next. The turbulent political weather of the twenty- first century generates anxiety and makes it difficult to know how to react. Olivia Laing makes a brilliant, inspiring case for why art matters more than ever, as a force of both resistance and repair. Art, she argues, changes how we see the world. It gives us X-ray vision. It reveals inequalities and offers fertile new ways of living. Funny Weather brings together a career's worth of Laing's writing about art and culture, and their role in our political and emotional lives. She profiles Jean-Michel Basquiat and Georgia O'Keeffe, interviews Hilary Mantel and Ali Smith, writes love letters to David Bowie and Wolfgang Tillmans, and explores loneliness and technology, women and alcohol, sex and the body. With characteristic originality and compassion, Funny Weather celebrates art as an antidote to a terrifying political moment-- Provided by publisher.||1 volume||701.03|BOOK - Book|[2020]|2020|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781324005704?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wCS9yQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

In the aftermath of stress, disappointment, and trauma, people often fall into survival mode, even while a part of them longs for more. Juggling multiple demands and responsibilities keeps them busy, but not healed. As a survivor of sexual assault, racism, and evacuation from a civil war in Liberia, Dr. Thema Bryant knows intimately the work involved in healing. Having made the journey herself, in addition to guiding others as a clinical psychologist and ordained minister, Dr. Thema shows you how to reconnect with your authentic self and reclaim your time, your voice, your life. Signs of disconnection from self can take many forms, including people-pleasing, depression, anxiety, and resentment. Healing starts with recognizing and expressing emotions in an honest way and reconnecting with the neglected parts of yourself, but it can't be done in a vacuum. Dr. Thema gives you the tools to meaningfully connect with your larger community, even if you face racism and sexism, heartbreak, grief, and trauma. Rather than shrinking in the face of life's difficulties, you will discover in Homecoming the therapeutic approaches and spiritual practices to live a more expansive life characterized by empowerment, healthier relationships, gratitude, and a deeper sense of purpose.||xix, 230 pages ; 24 cm||158|BOOK - Book|[2022]|2022-03-15|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593418314?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-KZPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

But before long, Jo found herself riddled with questions. How do you make a marriage work in a world where you no longer need to be married? How does an independent, strong-willed feminist become someone's partner -- all the time? In the tradition of writers such as Nora Ephron and Elizabeth Gilbert, award-winning journalist and nationally bestselling author Jo Piazza writes a provocative memoir of a real first year of marriage that will forever change the way we look at matrimony. A travel editor constantly on the move, Jo journeys to twenty countries on five continents to figure out what modern marriage means. Throughout this stunning, funny, warm, and wise personal narrative, she gleans wisdom from matrilineal tribeswomen, French ladies who lunch, Orthodox Jewish moms, Swedish stay-at-home dads, polygamous warriors, and Dutch prostitutes. Written with refreshing candor, elegant prose, astute reporting, and hilarious insight into the human psyche, How to Be Married offers an honest portrait of an utterly charming couple. When life throws more at them than they ever expected -- a terrifying health diagnosis, sick parents to care for, unemployment -- they ultimately create a fresh understanding of what it means to be equal partners during the good and bad times. Through their journey, they reveal a framework that will help the rest of us keep our marriages strong, from engagement into the newlywed years and beyond--Amazon.com.||xviii, 294 pages ; 19 cm||306.81|BOOK - Book|[2018]|2018-06-19|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780451495570?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yIJcDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, depression and dementia are today the nation's leading causes of death and disability. Half of all American adults currently suffer with a chronic disease, with one in four people suffering from two or more. Despite the statistics, so much confusion exists about what we can do to protect ourselves and live long, healthy lives. Acclaimed functional medicine doctor Rangan Chatterjee writes, The good news is that I can make these diseases disappear. That's right. This probably sounds like an extraordinary claim, but the reason I can make them disappear is that they're an illusion. These diseases are not the inevitable result of aging. They are not simply our genetic fate or our destiny. We do not have to suffer needlessly. The truth is these diseases don't really exist, at least not in the way we think they do. A life free of disease revolves around Dr. Chatterjee's four pillars: relaxation, food, sleep and movement. By making small, achievable changes in each of these key areas, you can create and maintain good health--and, most importantly, avoid and reverse illness. Based on cutting-edge research and fascinating case studies from real patients, How to Make Disease Disappear is a practical and revolutionary path to avoiding disease and embracing the health we all deserve.--Dust jacket.||231 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm||613|BOOK - Book|[2018]|2018-05-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062846341?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CfOdswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

But much of the emotional misery we feel is an overreaction, and it can be significantly reduced, using the techniques you'll find in this landmark book. World renowned therapist Dr. Albert Ellis, who created Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), believed that anger, anxiety and depression are not only unnecessary, they're unethical, because when we allow ourselves to become emotionally upset, we're being unfair and unjust to ourselves. Thinking negative thoughts is a choice we can refuse to make. Applying the proven, time-tested principles of REBT is a simple, logical way to find true mental health and happiness. REBT acknowledges the power of emotions, but it also helps us understand which feelings are healthy and which are not.

It was a journey of sharp, often brutal contrasts. At one moment he would be exploring the old streets of Baghdad or the ancient ruins of Babylon. At the next he would be visiting the war-torn city of Mosul, or learning about the horrific Speicher massacre in Tikrit. Now he shares the journal he meticulously kept during his trip, in which he describes the very varied places he visited, the people he met and the impressions he formed of a country that few outsiders now venture to see. Illustrated throughout with colour photographs taken on the trip, and permeated with his warmth and humour, this is a vivid and varied portrait of a complex country.||171 pages : colour illustrations, colour maps ; 23 cm||956.7|BOOK - Book|2022.||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781529153118?s=MD|

The book will feature a brand new introduction, a Q&A with Ecco publisher and Bourdain's long-time editor Daniel Halpern. Interior pages are hand-annotated by Anthony Bourdain himself. The interior will also feature a brand new drawing by Ralph Steadman. Almost two decades ago, the New Yorker published a now infamous article, Don't Eat before You Read This, by then little-known chef Anthony Bourdain. Bourdain spared no one's appetite as he revealed what happens behind the kitchen door. The article was a sensation, and the book it spawned, the now classic Kitchen Confidential, became an even bigger sensation, a megabestseller with over one million copies in print.
