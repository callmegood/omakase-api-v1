An essential read for understanding some of the egregious abuses of power that dominate today's news. Impassioned.... Entertaining reading.  - The Washington Post    Anand Giridharadas takes us into the inner sanctums of a new gilded age, where the rich and powerful fight for equality and justice any way they can-except ways that threaten the social order and their position atop it. They rebrand themselves as saviors of the poor; they lavishly reward thought leaders who redefine change in ways that preserve the status quo; and they constantly seek to do more good, but never less harm.        Giridharadas asks hard questions: Why, for example, should our gravest problems be solved by the unelected upper crust instead of the public institutions it erodes by lobbying and dodging taxes? His groundbreaking investigation has already forced a great, sorely needed reckoning among the world's wealthiest and those they hover above, and it points toward an answer: Rather than rely on scraps from the winners, we must take on the grueling democratic work of building more robust, egalitarian institutions and truly changing the world-a call to action for elites and everyday citizens alike.||1 online resource||303.40973|ebook - ebook|08/28/2018|2018-08-28|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780451493255?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eURBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Vanity Fair  photo editor Rachel DeLoache Williams's new friend Anna Delvey, a self-proclaimed German heiress, was worldly and ambitious. She was also generous-picking up the tab for lavish dinners at Le Coucou, infrared sauna sessions at HigherDOSE, drinks at the 11 Howard Library bar, and regular workout sessions with a celebrity personal trainer.   When Anna proposed an all-expenses-paid trip to Marrakech at the five-star La Mamounia hotel, Rachel jumped at the chance. But when Anna's credit cards mysteriously stopped working, the dream vacation quickly took a dark turn. Anna asked Rachel to begin fronting costs-first for flights, then meals and shopping, and, finally, for their $7,500-per-night private villa. Before Rachel knew it, more than $62,000 had been charged to her credit cards. Anna swore she would reimburse Rachel the moment they returned to New York.   Back in Manhattan, the repayment never materialized, and a shocking pattern of deception emerged. Rachel learned that Anna had left a trail of deceit-and unpaid bills-wherever she'd been. Mortified, Rachel contacted the district attorney, and in a stunning turn of events, found herself helping to bring down one of the city's most notorious con artists.   With breathless pacing and in-depth reporting from the person who experienced it firsthand,  My Friend Anna  is an unforgettable true story of money, power, greed, and female friendship.||1 online resource||364.163092|ebook - ebook|07/23/2019|2019-07-23|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781982114114?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TWqGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Shirk|Nonfiction., History., Politics., Electronic books.|China|For decades, China's rise to power was characterized by its reassurance that this rise would be peaceful. Then, as Susan L. Shirk, shows in this sobering, clear-eyed account of China today, something changed.  For three decades after Mao's death in 1976, China's leaders adopted a restrained approach to foreign policy. They determined that any threat to their power, and that of the Chinese Communist Party, came not from abroad but from withina conclusion cemented by the 1989 Tiananmen crisis. To facilitate the country's inexorable economic ascendence, and to prevent a backlash, they reassured the outside world of China's peaceful intentions. Then, as Susan Shirk shows in this illuminating, disturbing, and utterly persuasive new book, something changed. China went from fragile superpower to global heavyweight, threatening Taiwan as well as its neighbors in the South China Sea, tightening its grip on Hong Kong, and openly challenging the United States for preeminence not just economically and technologically but militarily. China began to overreach. Combining her decades of research and experience, Shirk, one of the world's most respected experts on Chinese politics, argues that we are now fully embroiled in a new cold war. To explain what happened, Shirk pries open the black box of China's political system and looks at what derailed its peaceful rise. As she shows, the shift toward confrontation began in the mid-2000s under the mild-mannered Hu Jintao, first among equals in a collective leadership. As China's economy boomed, especially after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, Hu and the other leaders lost restraint, abetting aggression toward the outside world and unchecked domestic social control. When Xi Jinping took power in 2012, he capitalized on widespread official corruption and open splits in the leadership to make the case for more concentrated power at the top. In the decade following, and to the present daythe eve of the 20th CCP Congress when he intends to claim a third termhe has accumulated greater power than any leader since Mao. Those who implement Xi's directives compete to outdo one another, provoking an even greater global backlash and stoking jingoism within China on a scale not seen since the Cultural Revolution. Here is a devastatingly lucid portrait of China today. Shirk's extensive interviews and meticulous analysis reveal the dynamics driving overreach. To counter it, she argues, the worst mistake the rest of the world, and the United States in particular, can make is to overreact. Understanding the domestic roots of China's actions will enable us to avoid the mistakes that could lead to war.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|10/07/2022|2022|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780190068523?s=MD|

Almost as if by magic, in city after city, from Palermo to Paris to Venice, huge crowds gathered, sometimes peaceful and sometimes violent, and the political order that had held sway since the defeat of Napoleon simply collapsed. Christopher Clark's spectacular new book recreates with verve, wit and insight this extraordinary period. Some rulers gave up at once, others fought bitterly, but everywhere new politicians, beliefs and expectations surged forward. The role of women in society, the end of slavery, the right to work, national independence and the final emancipation of the Jews all became live issues. In a brilliant series of set-pieces, Clark conjures up both this ferment of new ideas and then the increasingly ruthless and effective series of counter-attacks launched by regimes who still turned out to have many cards to play. But even in defeat, exiles spread the ideas of 1848 around the world and - for better and sometimes much worse - a new and very different Europe emerged from the wreckage.||1 online resource||940.28|ebook - ebook|04/27/2023|2023-04-27|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780241347676?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9kV4EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In this compelling account, Hayton shows how China's present-day geopolitical problems-the fates of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang, and the South China Sea-were born in the struggle to create a modern nation-state. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, reformers and revolutionaries adopted foreign ideas to invent' a new vision of China. By asserting a particular, politicized version of the past the government bolstered its claim to a vast territory stretching from the Pacific to Central Asia. Ranging across history, nationhood, language, and territory, Hayton shows how the Republic's reworking of its past not only helped it to justify its right to rule a century ago-but continues to motivate and direct policy today.||1 online resource||951|ebook - ebook|10/01/2020|2020-10-13|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780300256062?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4u8CEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

They were cousins, on a pilgrimage to see their childhood homes, from which they and their families had been driven out nearly twenty years earlier. One cousin had the door slammed in his face, one found that his old house had been converted into a school.

Eric H Cline.||Cline, Eric H.|Cline, Eric H.||Nonfiction., History., Sociology., Electronic books.||In 1177 B.C., marauding groups known only as the Sea Peoples invaded Egypt. The pharaoh's army and navy managed to defeat them, but the victory so weakened Egypt that it soon slid into decline, as did most of the surrounding civilizations. After centuries of brilliance, the civilized world of the Bronze Age came to an abrupt and cataclysmic end. Kingdoms fell like dominoes over the course of just a few decades. No more Minoans or Mycenaeans. No more Trojans, Hittites, or Babylonians. The thriving economy and cultures of the late second millennium B.C., which had stretched from Greece to Egypt and Mesopotamia, suddenly ceased to exist, along with writing systems, technology, and monumental architecture. But the Sea Peoples alone could not have caused such widespread breakdown. How did it happen?In this major new account of the causes of this First Dark Ages, Eric Cline tells the gripping story of how the end was brought about by multiple interconnected failures, ranging from invasion and revolt to earthquakes, drought, and the cutting of international trade routes. Bringing to life the vibrant multicultural world of these great civilizations, he draws a sweeping panorama of the empires and globalized peoples of the Late Bronze Age and shows that it was their very interdependence that hastened their dramatic collapse and ushered in a dark age that lasted centuries.A compelling combination of narrative and the latest scholarship, 1177 B.C. sheds new light on the complex ties that gave rise to, and ultimately destroyed, the flourishing civilizations of the Late Bronze Age-and that set the stage for the emergence of classical Greece.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|09/22/2015||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781400874491?s=MD|

Matt Dickinson.|1999: Manchester United, the Treble and All That|Dickinson, Matt|Dickinson, Matt.|Matt Dickinson|Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., Sports & Recreations., Electronic books.|Sports & Recreation|In 1999, Manchester United completed a unique Treble, winning the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League - but more remarkable than that was how they did it, and the stories behind the historic achievement. Matt Dickinson covered the whole story at the time, and now in 99 compelling chapters brings it all vividly to life.  When the season began, Manchester United were up for sale, the club's iconic talisman  Eric Cantona  had gone, rivals Arsenal were the reigning Double winners,  David Beckham  was a national hate figure after being sent off during the World Cup, and even manager  Alex Ferguson 's position was being questioned. Early signs weren't promising, despite record spending to bring in new stars, among them Jaap Stam and Dwight Yorke, but soon things began to change. Driven by the indomitable will of skipper  Roy Keane , supported by a nucleus from the Class of 92 -  Beckham, Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, the Nevilles and Paul Scholes  - who had grown up at the club, they went on a long unbeaten and unbeatable run, featuring some of the most dramatic games in fans' memories. Matt Dickinson highlights the key moments, speaking to those at the centre of the story and to those whose moment went unnoticed.  1999: Manchester United, the Treble and All That  is so much more than a book for United fans; it is an insight into team building, the will to success and a tale of local pride. It reveals the real stories behind the legend that was sealed with a last-minute scrambled goal from  Ole Gunnar Solskjaer  to win the Champions League.||1 online resource||796.3340942733|ebook - ebook|08/18/2022|2022-08-18|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781398503793?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T2lQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

From the beginnings of Chinese prehistory right through to internet censorship with the 'Great Firewall of China', Gordon Kerr offers a comprehensive introduction to the sprawling history of this enormous country. A Short History of China provides an absorbing introduction to more than 4,000 years of Chinese history, telling the stories of the tyrants, despots, femmes fatales, artists, warriors and philosophers who have shaped this fascinating and complex nation. It describes the amazing technological advances that her scientists and inventors made many hundreds of years before similar discoveries in Europe. It also investigates the Chinese view of the world and examines the movements, aspirations and philosophies that moulded it and, in so doing, created the Chinese nation. Finally, the book examines the dramatic changes of the last few decades and the emergence of China as an economic and industrial 21st century superpower, making Napoleon Bonaparte's words about her ring true: Let China sleep, for when she awakes, she will shake the world.||1 online resource||951|ebook - ebook|01/25/2013||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781842439692?s=MD|

Eric Metaxas.|Bonhoeffer|Metaxas, Eric|Metaxas, Eric.|Eric Metaxas|Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., Religion & Spirituality., Electronic books., Electronic book|Biography & Autobiography|WHO BETTER TO FACE THE GREATEST EVIL OF THE 20TH CENTURY THAN A HUMBLE MAN OF FAITH? As Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seduced a nation, bullied a continent, and attempted to exterminate the Jews of Europe, a small number of dissidents and saboteurs worked to dismantle the Third Reich from the inside. One of these was Dietrich Bonhoeffer—a pastor and author. In this New York Times best-selling biography, Eric Metaxas takes both strands of Bonhoeffer's life—the theologian and the spy—and draws them together to tell a searing story of incredible moral courage in the face of monstrous evil. Metaxas presents the fullest accounting of Bonhoeffer's heart-wrenching decision to leave the safe haven of America to return to Hitler's Germany, and sheds new light on Bonhoeffer's involvement in the famous Valkyrie plot and in Operation 7, the effort to smuggle Jews into neutral Switzerland. In a deeply moving narrative, Metaxas uses previously unavailable documents?including personal letters, detailed journal entries, and firsthand personal accounts?to reveal dimensions of Bonhoeffer's life and theology never before seen. Bonhoeffer is the story of a life framed by a passion for truth and a commitment to justice on behalf of those who face implacable evil. Includes Readers' Guide [A] beautifully constructed biography. —Alan Wolfe, The New Republic  Metaxas tells Bonhoeffer's story with passion and theological sophistication. . . . —Wall Street Journal [A] weighty, riveting analysis of the life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. . . . —Publishers Weekly Metaxas presents Bonhoeffer as a clear-headed, deeply convicted Christian who submitted to no one and nothing except God and his Word. —Christianity Today Metaxas has written a book that adds a new dimension to World War II, a new understanding of how evil can seize the soul of a nation and a man of faith can confront it. . . . —Thomas Fleming, author, The New Dealers' War Metaxas has created a biography of uncommon power—intelligent, moving, well researched,vividly written, and rich in implication for our own lives. Or to put it another way: Buy this book. Read it. Then buy another copy and give it to a person you love.

China's Civilian Army charts China's transformation from an isolated and impoverished communist state to a global superpower from the perspective of those on the front line: China's diplomats. They give a rare perspective on the greatest geopolitical drama of the last half century. In the early days of the People's Republic, diplomats were highly-disciplined, committed communists who feared revealing any weakness to the threatening capitalist world. Remarkably, the model that revolutionary leader Zhou Enlai established continues to this day despite the massive changes the country has undergone in recent decades. Little is known or understood about the inner workings of the Chinese government as the country bursts onto the world stage, as the world's second largest economy and an emerging military superpower. China's Diplomats embody its battle between insecurity and self-confidence, internally and externally. To this day, Chinese diplomats work in pairs so that one can always watch the other for signs of ideological impurity. They're often dubbed China's wolf warriors for their combative approach to asserting Chinese interests. Drawing for the first time on the memoirs of more than a hundred retired diplomats as well as author Peter Martin's first-hand reporting as a journalist in Beijing, this groundbreaking book blends history with current events to tease out enduring lessons about the kind of power China is set to become. It is required reading for anyone who wants to understand China's quest for global power, as seen from the inside.||1 online resource||327.510|ebook - ebook|05/13/2021||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780197513712?s=MD|

Jane Mayer.|Dark Money|Mayer, Jane|Mayer, Jane.|Jane Mayer|Nonfiction., History., Politics., Electronic books., Electronic book|Political Science|Why is America living in an age of profound economic inequality? Why, despite the desperate need to address climate change, have even modest environmental efforts been defeated again and again? Why have protections for employees been decimated? Why do hedge-fund billionaires pay a far lower tax rate than middle-class workers? The conventional answer is that a popular uprising against big government led to the ascendancy of a broad-based conservative movement. But as Jane Mayer shows in this powerful, meticulously reported history, a network of exceedingly wealthy people with extreme libertarian views bankrolled a systematic, step-by-step plan to fundamentally alter the American political system.  The network has brought together some of the richest people on the planet. Their core beliefs—that taxes are a form of tyranny; that government oversight of business is an assault on freedom—are sincerely held. But these beliefs also advance their personal and corporate interests: Many of their companies have run afoul of federal pollution, worker safety, securities, and tax laws. The chief figures in the network are Charles and David Koch, whose father made his fortune in part by building oil refineries in Stalin's Russia and Hitler's Germany. The patriarch later was a founding member of the John Birch Society, whose politics were so radical it believed Dwight Eisenhower was a communist. The brothers were schooled in a political philosophy that asserted the only role of government is to provide security and to enforce property rights.  When libertarian ideas proved decidedly unpopular with voters, the Koch brothers and their allies chose another path. If they pooled their vast resources, they could fund an interlocking array of organizations that could work in tandem to influence and ultimately control academic institutions, think tanks, the courts, statehouses, Congress, and, they hoped, the presidency. Richard Mellon Scaife, the mercurial heir to banking and oil fortunes, had the brilliant insight that most of their political activities could be written off as tax-deductible philanthropy. These organizations were given innocuous names such as Americans for Prosperity. Funding sources were hidden whenever possible. This process reached its apotheosis with the allegedly populist Tea Party movement, abetted mightily by the Citizens United decision—a case conceived of by legal advocates funded by the network. The political operatives the network employs are disciplined, smart, and at times ruthless. Mayer documents instances in which people affiliated with these groups hired private detectives to impugn whistle-blowers, journalists, and even government investigators. And their efforts have been remarkably successful. Libertarian views on taxes and regulation, once far outside the mainstream and still rejected by most Americans, are ascendant in the majority of state governments, the Supreme Court, and Congress. Meaningful environmental, labor, finance, and tax reforms have been stymied.  Jane Mayer spent five years conducting hundreds of interviews-including with several sources within the network-and scoured public records, private papers, and court proceedings in reporting this book. In a taut and utterly convincing narrative, she traces the byzantine trail of the billions of dollars spent by the network and provides vivid portraits of the colorful figures behind the new American oligarchy. Dark Money is a book that must be read by anyone who cares about the future of American democracy.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|01/19/2016|2016-01-19|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780385535601?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X5nrCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Sandel|Nonfiction., Politics, Practical, Liberalism, Democracy, Civil rights, Citizenship, Politics, Practical., Citizenship United States., Civil rights United States., Liberalism United States., Democracy United States., History., Philosophy., Politics., United States, Electronic books.|Philosophy|A renowned political philosopher updates his classic book on the American political tradition to address the perils democracy confronts today.  The 1990s were a heady time. The Cold War had ended, and America's version of liberal capitalism seemed triumphant. And yet, amid the peace and prosperity, anxieties about the project of self-government could be glimpsed beneath the surface. So argued Michael Sandel, in his influential and widely debated book  Democracy's Discontent,  published in 1996. The market faith was eroding the common life. A rising sense of disempowerment was likely to provoke backlash, he wrote, from those who would shore up borders, harden the distinction between insiders and outsiders, and promise a politics to 'take back our culture and take back our country,' to 'restore our sovereignty' with a vengeance. Now, a quarter century later, Sandel updates his classic work for an age when democracy's discontent has hardened into a country divided against itself. In this new edition, he extends his account of America's civic struggles from the 1990s to the present. He shows how Democrats and Republicans alike embraced a version of finance-driven globalization that created a society of winners and losers and fueled the toxic politics of our time. In a work celebrated when first published as a remarkable fusion of philosophical and historical scholarship (Alan Brinkley), Sandel recalls moments in the American past when the country found ways to hold economic power to democratic account. To reinvigorate democracy, Sandel argues in a stirring new epilogue, we need to reconfigure the economy and empower citizens as participants in a shared public life.||1 online resource||320.973|ebook - ebook|10/28/2022|2022-10-28|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780674287440?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g0GaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Few back then would have predicted that this young man would eventually become one of the towering figures of the twentieth century. Peres would indeed go on to serve the new nation as prime minister, president, foreign minister, and the head of several other ministries. He was central to the establishment of the Israeli Defense Forces and the defense industry that would provide the young nation with a robust deterrent power. He was crucial to launching Israel's nuclear energy program and to the creation of its high-tech Start Up Nation revolution. His refusal to surrender to conventional wisdom and political conventions helped save the Israeli economy and prompted some of the most daring military operations in history, among them the legendary Operation Entebbe. And yet, as important as his role in creating and deploying Israel's armed forces was, his stunning transition from hawk to dove-with its accompanying unwavering commitment to peace-made him one of the globe's most recognized, honored, and admired statesmen. In this, his final work, finished only weeks before his passing, Peres offers a long-awaited examination of the crucial turning points in Israeli history through the prism of having been a decision maker and eyewitness. Told with the frankness of someone aware this would likely be his final statement, No Room for Small Dreams spans decades and events, but as much as it is about what happened, it is about why it happened. Examining pivotal moments in Israel's rise, Peres explores what makes for a great leader, how to make hard choices in a climate of uncertainty and distress, the challenges of balancing principles with policies, and the liberating nature of imagination and unpredicted innovation. In doing so, he not only charts a better path forward for his beloved country but provides deep and universal wisdom for younger generations who seek to lead-be it in politics, business, or the broader service of making our planet a safer, more peaceful, and just place.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|04/16/2024|2017-09-12|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062561466?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yAQvDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

'The seminal English language work on the subject'   Sunday Times    'A major contribution to scholarship on modern China, one that is unequalled, certainly in the English language ... both revealing and rewarding reading – for specialists and non-specialists alike'   Literary Review     After the economic disaster of the Great Leap Forward that claimed tens of millions of lives between 1958 and 1962, an ageing Mao launched an ambitious scheme to shore up his reputation and eliminate those he viewed as a threat to his legacy. The stated goal of the Cultural Revolution was to purge the country of bourgeois, capitalist elements he claimed were threatening genuine communist ideology. But the Chairman also used the Cultural Revolution to turn on his colleagues, some of them longstanding comrades-in-arms, subjecting them to public humiliation, imprisonment and torture. Young students formed Red Guards, vowing to defend the Chairman to the death, but soon rival factions started fighting each other in the streets with semi-automatic weapons in the name of revolutionary purity. As the country descended into chaos, the military intervened, turning China into a garrison state marked by bloody purges that crushed as many as one in fifty people. When the army itself fell victim to the Cultural Revolution, ordinary people used the political chaos to resurrect the market and hollow out the party's ideology. In short, they buried Maoism. In-depth interviews and archival research at last give voice to the people and the complex choices they faced, undermining the picture of conformity that is often understood to have characterised the last years of Mao's regime. By demonstrating that decollectivisation from below was an unintended consequence of a decade of violent purges and entrenched fear, Frank Dikötter casts China's most tumultuous era in a wholly new light. Written with unprecedented access to previously classified party documents from secret police reports to unexpurgated versions of leadership speeches, this third chapter in Frank Dikötter's extraordinarily lucid and ground-breaking 'People's Trilogy' is a devastating reassessment of the history of the People's Republic of China.||1 online resource||951.056|ebook - ebook|05/05/2016|2016-05-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781408856512?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DM3PCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Nathan Thrall.||Thrall, Nathan|Thrall, Nathan.||Nonfiction., History., Politics., Sociology., Electronic books.||In a myth-busting analysis of the world's most intractable conflict, a star of Middle East reporting, one of the most important writers in the field ( The New York Times ), argues that only one weapon has yielded progress: force.  Scattered over the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea lie the remnants of failed peace proposals, international summits, secret negotiations, UN resolutions, and state-building efforts. The conventional story is that these well-meaning attempts at peacemaking were repeatedly, perhaps terminally, thwarted by violence. Through a rich interweaving of reportage, historical narrative, and powerful analysis, Nathan Thrall presents a startling counter-history. He shows that force—including but not limited to violence—has impelled each side to make its largest concessions, from Palestinian acceptance of a two-state solution to Israeli territorial withdrawals. This simple fact has been neglected by the world powers, which have expended countless resources on initiatives meant to diminish friction between the parties. By quashing any hint of confrontation, promising an imminent negotiated solution, facilitating security cooperation, developing the institutions of a still unborn Palestinian state, and providing bounteous economic and military assistance, the United States and Europe have merely entrenched the conflict by lessening the incentives to end it. Thrall's important book upends the beliefs steering these failed policies, revealing how the aversion of pain, not the promise of peace, has driven compromise for Israelis and Palestinians alike.  Published as Israel's occupation of East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza reaches its fiftieth anniversary, which is also the centenary of the Balfour Declaration that first promised a Jewish national home in Palestine,  The Only Language They Understand  advances a bold thesis that shatters ingrained positions of both left and right and provides a new and eye-opening understanding of this most vexed of lands.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|05/16/2017||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781627797108?s=MD|

More specif­ically, there could never be another Diana-a mem­ber of the family whose global popularity upstaged, outshone, and posed an existential threat to the Brit­ish monarchy. Picking up where Tina Brown's masterful  The Diana Chronicles  left off,  The Palace Papers  reveals how the royal family reinvented itself after the trau­matic years when Diana's blazing celebrity ripped through the House of Windsor like a comet. Brown takes readers on a tour de force journey through the scandals, love affairs, power plays, and betrayals that have buffeted the monarchy over the last twenty-five years. We see the Queen's stoic re­solve after the passing of Princess Margaret, the Queen Mother, and Prince Philip, her partner for seven decades, and how she triumphs in her Jubilee years even as family troubles rage around her. Brown explores Prince Charles's determination to make Camilla Parker Bowles his wife, the tension between William and Harry on different paths, the ascend­ance of Kate Middleton, the downfall of Prince An­drew, and Harry and Meghan's stunning decision to step back as senior royals. Despite the fragile monar­chy's best efforts, never again seems fast approaching. Tina Brown has been observing and chronicling the British monarchy for three decades, and her sweeping account is full of powerful revelations, newly reported details, and searing insight gleaned from remarkable access to royal insiders.

'By thinking about gendered inequality as rooted in something unalterable within us, we fail to see it for what it is: something more fragile that has had to be constantly remade and reasserted.' In this bold and radical book, award-winning science journalist Angela Saini goes in search of the true roots of gendered oppression, uncovering a complex history of how male domination became embedded in societies and spread across the globe from prehistory into the present. Travelling to the world's earliest known human settlements, analysing the latest research findings in science and archaeology, and tracing cultural and political histories from the Americas to Asia, she overturns simplistic universal theories to show that what patriarchy is and how far it goes back really depends on where you are. Despite the push back against sexism and exploitation in our own time, even revolutionary efforts to bring about equality have often ended in failure and backlash. Saini ends by asking what part we all play – women included – in keeping patriarchal structures alive, and why we need to look beyond the old narratives to understand why it persists in the present.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|03/02/2023|2023-03-02|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008418120?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mnl-EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

National Post       Hidden Hand is heavily sourced, crisply written, and deeply alarming. - The Times    Revelatory ... A partisan, detailed and necessary examination. - Sunday Times    Hidden Hand should be required reading for our diplomats, intelligence analysts, military officers and businesspeople. - The Australian    A remarkable book with a chilling message ... The book's convincing message is plain ... Everyone must stay on their guard. - Will Hutton The Guardian    An in-depth explanation of how China conducts its operations to gain important knowledge - ranging from tech secrets to financial information. - International Business Times   Heavily Sod, Crisply Written and Deeply Alarming The Time, London   Governments around the world are in the early stages of a repositioning of power, as China rises and the United States is drawn into direct competition. However, some are beginning to wonder whether, for all of the economic benefits, engaging with China carries unseen dangers.   The Chinese Communist Party is now determined to reshape the world in its image. The party is not interested in democracy. It divides the world into those who can be won over and enemies. They have already lured many leaders to their corner; others are weighing up a devil's bargain.   Hidden Hand is a detailed and devastating expose of the Chinese Communist Party's influence in the West, including Canada. It could not arrive at a better time in Canada, with relations between Ottawa and Beijing reaching breaking point after two years of mounting tension. China's bullying behaviour, and the mobilizing of people loyal to the Chinese Communist Party on the streets of Canada's cities, has caused deep disquiet among Canadians.   But the government seems paralyzed. Hidden Hand shows how Canada's political, business, academic and cultural elites have over many years been co-opted by the Chinese Communist Party and its agencies. They are confused about what is in Canada's national interests and frequently do Beijing's bidding. Hidden Hand shows how the Chinese Communist Party represents a profound threat to Western democracy.   It's vital reading for Canadians who want to understand what is really happening, and points to a way of carving out a new diplomatic course with China. But the question remains: Does the government have the will to stand up to Beijing and its proxies in Canada or is it too late?

Brant Pitre.|Jesus the Bridegroom|Pitre, Brant|Pitre, Brant.|Brant Pitre|Jesus Christ Crucifixion., Jesus Christ Jewish interpretations., Nonfiction., Bridegrooms Miscellanea., Messiah Biblical teaching., Religion & Spirituality., Electronic books.|Religion|In Jesus the Bridegroom, Brant Pitre once again taps into the wells of Jewish Scripture and tradition, and unlocks the secrets of what is arguably the most well-known symbol of the Christian faith: the cross of Christ. In this thrilling exploration, Pitre shows how the suffering and death of Jesus was far more than a tragic Roman execution. Instead, the Passion of Christ was the fulfillment of ancient Jewish prophecies of a wedding, when the God of the universe would wed himself to humankind in an everlasting nuptial covenant.   To be sure, most Christians are familiar with the apostle Paul's teaching that Christ is the 'Bridegroom' and the Church is the 'Bride'. But what does this really mean? And what would ever possess Paul to compare the death of Christ to the love of a husband for his wife? If you would have been at the Crucifixion, with Jesus hanging there dying, is that how you would have described it? How could a first-century Jew like Paul, who knew how brutal Roman crucifixions were, have ever compared the execution of Jesus to a wedding? And why does he refer to this as the great mystery (Ephesians 5:32)?   As Pitre shows, the key to unlocking this mystery can be found by going back to Jewish Scripture and tradition and seeing the entire history of salvation, from Mount Sinai to Mount Calvary, as a divine love story between Creator and creature, between God and Israel, between Christ and his bride--a story that comes to its climax on the wood of a Roman cross.     In the pages of Jesus the Bridegroom, dozens of familiar passages in the Bible--the Exodus, the Song of Songs, the Wedding at Cana, the Woman at the Well, the Last Supper, the Crucifixion, and even the Second Coming at the End of Time--are suddenly transformed before our eyes. Indeed, when seen in the light of Jewish Scripture and tradition, the life of Christ is nothing less than the greatest love story ever told.||1 online resource||232.3|ebook - ebook|03/11/2014|2014-03-11|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780770435462?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3SnbAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Life expectancy has declined, economic inequality has soared, and, after some progress, the Black-white wage gap is once again as large as it was in the 1950s. How did this happen in the world’s most powerful country? And what happened to the “American dream”—the promise of a happier, healthier, more prosperous future—which was once such an inextricable part of our national identity? Drawing on decades of writing about the economy for  The New York Times,  Pulitzer Prize–winning writer David Leonhardt examines the past century of American history, from the Great Depression to today’s Great Stagnation, in search of an answer. To make sense of the rise and subsequent fall of the American dream, Leonhardt tells the story of the modern American economy as an ongoing battle between two competing forms of capitalism: one that envisions prosperity for most, and one that serves the individual and favors the wealthy. In vivid prose,  Ours Was the Shining Future  traces how democratic capitalism flourished to make the American dream possible, until the latter decades of the twentieth century when, bit by bit, the dream was corrupted to serve only the privileged few.  Ours Was the Shining Future  is a sweeping narrative full of innovation and grit, human drama and hope. Featuring the trailblazing figures who helped shape the American dream—Frances Perkins, Paul Hoffman, Cesar Chavez, Robert Kennedy, A. Philip Randolph, Grace Hopper, and more—this engaging history reveals the power of grassroots democratic movements from across the political spectrum. And though the American dream feels lost to us now, Leonhardt shows how Americans—if they commit themselves to transforming the economy, as they did in the past—have the power to revive the dream once more.||1 online resource||330.973|ebook - ebook|10/24/2023|2023-10-24|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780679644859?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4VOpEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

But though she had the support of the agency, Andrea grew frustrated with the service's bureaucratic idiosyncrasies, and left the force after twelve years. Two decades later, however, she stumbles across a mystery that pulls her right back where she left off: three young men have vanished from the Pacific Crest Trail, the 2,650-mile trek made famous by Cheryl Strayed's  Wild , and no one has been able to find them. It’s bugging the hell out of her.     Andrea’s concern soon leads her to a wild environment unlike any she’s ever encountered: missing person Facebook groups. Andrea launches an investigation, joining forces with an eclectic team of amateurs who are determined to solve the cases by land and by screen: a mother of the missing, a retired pharmacy manager, and a mapmaker who monitors terrorist activity for the government. Together, they track the activities of kidnappers and murderers, investigate a cult, rescue a psychic in peril, cross paths with an unconventional scientist, and reunite an international fugitive with his family. Searching for the missing is a brutal psychological and physical test with the highest stakes, but eventually their hardships begin to bear strange fruits—ones that lead them to places and people they never saw coming.     Beautifully written, heartfelt, and at times harrowing,   TRAIL OF THE LOST   paints a vivid picture of hiker culture and its complicated relationship with the ever-expanding online realm, all while exploring the power and limits of determination, generosity, and hope. It also offers a deep awe of the natural world, even as it unearths just how vast and treacherous it can be.      On the   TRAIL OF THE LOST  , you may not find what you are looking for, but you will certainly find more than you seek.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|08/22/2023|2023-08-22|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780306831973?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bzKgEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Richard E Mshomba.|Africa and Preferential Trade|Mshomba, Richard E.|Mshomba, Richard E.|Richard E. Mshomba|Nonfiction., Business., Politics., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|Nonreciprocal preferential trade arrangements are a defining feature of the relationship between developed and developing countries dating back to the colonial era. In the late 1950s, these arrangements started to take a multilateral form when members of the European Economic Community established special trade arrangements with their colonies. Since then, several trade arrangements have featured African countries among the preference-receiving countries. Yet it is not always clear how preferential these arrangements are and whether they in fact help African countries or instead lead them to perpetual dependence on specific markets and products.   Richard E. Mshomba carefully examines the history of these programs and their salient features. He analyzes negotiations between the EU and African countries to form Economic Partnership Agreements. Nonreciprocal preferential trade arrangements are often unpredictable, since the duration and magnitude of preferences are at the discretion of the preference-giving countries. However, when used in conjunction with other development programs and with laws and regulations that encourage long-term investment and protect employees, they can increase economic opportunities and foster human development. This book recognizes the potential impact of nonreciprocal preferential trade arrangements and provides recommendations to increase their viability.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|09/10/2024|2024-09-10|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781503640429?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=18kUEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Louisa Lim.|Indelible City|Lim, Louisa|Lim, Louisa.|Louisa Lim|Nonfiction., History., Politics., Protest movements, Social movements, China Hong Kong, Politics and government, Social conditions, Electronic books.|History|An award-winning journalist and longtime Hong Konger indelibly captures the place, its people, and the untold history they are claiming, just as it is being erased.    The story of Hong Kong has long been dominated by competing myths: to Britain, a barren rock with no appreciable history; to China, a part of Chinese soil from time immemorial, at last returned to the ancestral folded For decades, Hong Kong's history was simply not taught, especially to Hong Kongers, obscuring its origins as a place of refuge and rebellion. When protests erupted in 2019 and were met with escalating suppression from Beijing, Louisa Lim-raised in Hong Kong as a half-Chinese, half-English child, and now a reporter who has covered the region for nearly two decades-realized that she was uniquely positioned to unearth the city's untold stories.     Lim's deeply researched and personal account casts startling new light on key moments: the British takeover in 1842, the negotiations over the 1997 return to China, and the future Beijing seeks to impose.  Indelible City  features guerrilla calligraphers, amateur historians and archaeologists, and others who, like Lim, aim to put Hong Kongers at the center of their own story. Wending through it all is the King of Kowloon, whose iconic street art both embodied and inspired the identity of Hong Kong-a site of disappearance and reappearance, power and powerlessness, loss and reclamation.||1 online resource||303.4840951|ebook - ebook|04/19/2022|2022-04-19|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593191835?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eCM5EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

How can you discern when the Holy Spirit is authentically moving, or when a counterfeit spirit is producing manipulation?

Unfortunately many of the claims to the presence of the dove among us are nothing but pigeon religion.    Don't settle for a substitute.   Respected theologian Dr. R.T.

They had no idea that they had actually been hired for sub-contract work on an American military base in Iraq. But fate took an even darker turn when the dozen men were kidnapped and murdered by Islamic extremists. Their gruesome deaths were captured in one of the first graphic execution videos disseminated on the web-the largest massacre of contractors during the war. Compounding the tragedy, their deaths received little notice.Why were these men, from a remote country far removed from the war, in Iraq? How had they gotten there? Who were they working for? Consumed by these questions, award-winning investigative journalist Cam Simpson embarked on a journey to find answers, a decade-long odyssey that would uncover a web of evil spanning the globe-and trigger a chain of events involving one brave young widow, three indefatigable human rights lawyers, and a formidable multinational corporation with deep governmental ties.A heart-rending, page-turning narrative that moves from the Himalayas to the Middle East to Houston and culminates in an epic court battle, The Girl from Kathmandu is a story of death and life-of the war in Iraq, the killings of the twelve Nepalese, a journalist determined to uncover the truth, and a trio of human rights lawyers dedicated to finding justice. At its heart is one unforgettable young woman, Kamala Magar, who found the courage to face the influential men who sent her husband to his death-a model of strength hope, bravery, and an unbreakable spirit who reminds us of the power we all have to make a difference.||1 online resource||956.70443|ebook - ebook|05/21/2024|2018-04-17|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062449733?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hz0JEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Further, many analysts predict that America's autocratic rivals will have at least some success in disrupting-and, in the longer term, possibly even displacing-U.S. global leadership. Brilliant and engagingly written,  The Return of Great Power Rivalry  argues that this conventional wisdom is wrong. Drawing on an extraordinary range of historical evidence and the works of figures like Herodotus, Machiavelli, and Montesquieu and combining it with cutting-edge social science research, Matthew Kroenig advances the riveting argument that democracies tend to excel in great power rivalries. He contends that democracies actually have unique economic, diplomatic, and military advantages in long-run geopolitical competitions. He considers autocratic advantages as well, but shows that these are more than outweighed by their vulnerabilities.Kroenig then shows these arguments through the seven most important cases of democratic-versus-autocratic rivalries throughout history, from the ancient world to the Cold War. Finally, he analyzes the new era of great power rivalry among the United States, Russia, and China through the lens of the democratic advantage argument. By advancing a hard-power argument for democracy, Kroenig demonstrates that despite its many problems, the U.S. is better positioned to maintain a global leadership role than either Russia or China. A vitally important book for anyone concerned about the future of global geopolitics,  The Return of Great Power Rivalry  provides both an innovative way of thinking about power in international politics and an optimistic assessment of the future of American global leadership.|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||327.112|ebook - ebook|02/13/2020|2020-02-13|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780190080259?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LdbODwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

If John D. Rockefeller was creating unimagined wealth in the United States that he would put to the service of the nation, a Parsi family with humble roots was doing the same in India. In 1822, a boy was born in a priestly household in Gujarat's Navsari village. Young Nusserwanji knew early on that his destiny lay beyond his village and decided to head for Bombay to start a business - the first in his family to do so. He had neither higher education nor knowledge of business matters, just a burning passion to carve a path of his own. What Nusserwanji started as a cotton trading venture, his son Jamsetji, born in the same year as Rockefeller, grew into a multifaceted business, turning around sick textile mills, setting up an iron and steel company, envisioning a cutting-edge institute of higher learning, building a world-class hotel, and earning himself the title of the 'Bhishma Pitamah of Indian Industry'. Stewarded ably over the decades by Jamsetji's sons Dorabji and Ratanji, the charismatic and larger-than-life JRD, and thereafter the more business-like Ratan, the Tata group today is a 110-billion-dollar empire. The Tatas is their story. But it is more than just a history of the industrial house; it is an inspiring account of India in the making. It chronicles how each generation of the family invested not only in the expansion of its own business interests but also in nation building. Few know, for instance, that the first hydel power project in the world was conceived of and built by the Tatas. Nor that some radical labour concepts such as eight-hour work shifts were born in India, at the Tata mill in Nagpur. The Tata Cancer Research Centre, the Indian Institute of Science, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, as also the national carrier Air India - the family has a long, rich and unrivalled legacy. The Tatas is a tribute to a line of visionaries who have a special place in the hearts and minds of ordinary Indians. Written by seasoned journalist Girish Kuber, this is also the only book that tells the..."||1 online resource||338.70954|ebook - ebook|03/25/2019|2019-03-25|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9789352779383?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bKaODwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

'Alluring, gripping, real: an astonishing insight into the lives of three queens'  ALICE ROBERTS  'Takes us into the hearts and minds of three extraordinary women'  AMANDA FOREMAN  'Conveys the vitality of the past as few books do. An enviable tour de force'  SUZANNAH LIPSCOMB  Sixteenth-century Europe:  Renaissance masters paint the ceilings of Florentine churches, kings battle for control of the Continent, and the Reformation forever changes the religious organisation of society. Amidst it all, three young women come of age and into power in an era of empires and revolutions.  Catherine de' Medici's story begins in a convent stormed by soldiers intent on seizing the key to power in Florence - Catherine herself, a girl barely 11 years old. It ends with her as the controversial queen mother of France, a woman both revered and reviled.  Mary, Queen of Scots' story begins in Scotland and ends in England. A queen turned traitor, from the confines of her English prison she longs for the idyll of her childhood in France. Elisabeth de Valois' story begins in France, where she is born the beloved daughter of a king. It ends tragically in Spain as a cherished queen consort and mother - one who must make the ultimate sacrifice for her kingdom.  Catherine, Mary and Elisabeth lived at the French court together for many years before scattering to different kingdoms. These years bound them to one another through blood and marriage, alliance and friendship, love and filial piety; bonds that were tested when the women were forced to part and take on new roles. To rule, they would learn, was to wage a constant war against the deeply entrenched misogyny of their time. A crown could exalt a young woman. Equally, it could destroy her.  Drawing on new archival research,  Young Queens  masterfully weaves the personal stories of these three queens into one, revealing their hopes, dreams, desires and regrets in a time when even the most powerful women lived at the mercy of the state.||1 online resource||940.22|ebook - ebook|05/11/2023|2023-05-11|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781526613462?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6NZ1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Trump.  The 2016 election was a watershed for the United States. But, as Tim Alberta explains in American Carnage, to understand Trump's victory is to view him not as the creator of this era of polarization and bruising partisanship, but rather as its most manifest consequence.  American Carnage is the story of a president's rise based on a country's evolution and a party's collapse. As George W. Bush left office with record-low approval ratings and Barack Obama led a Democratic takeover of Washington, Republicans faced a moment of reckoning: They had no vision, no generation of new leaders, and no energy in the party's base. Yet Obama's forceful pursuit of his progressive agenda, coupled with the nation's rapidly changing cultural and demographic landscape, lit a fire under the right, returning Republicans to power and inviting a bloody struggle for the party's identity in the post-Bush era. The factions that emerged-one led by absolutists like Jim Jordan and Ted Cruz, the other led by pragmatists like John Boehner and Mitch McConnell-engaged in a series of devastating internecine clashes and attempted coups for control. With the GOP's internal fissures rendering it legislatively impotent, and that impotence fueling a growing resentment toward the political class and its institutions, the stage was set for an outsider to crash the party. When Trump descended a gilded escalator to announce his run in the summer of 2015, the candidate had met the moment.  Only by viewing Trump as the culmination of a decade-long civil war inside the Republican Party-and of the parallel sense of cultural, socioeconomic, and technological disruption during that period-can we appreciate how he won the White House and consider the fundamental questions at the center of America's current turmoil. How did a party obsessed with the national debt vote for trillion-dollar deficits and record-setting spending increases? How did the party of compassionate conservatism become the party of Muslim bans and walls? How did the party of family values elect a thrice-divorced philanderer? And, most important, how long can such a party survive?   Loaded with exclusive reporting and based off hundreds of interviews-including with key players such as President Trump, Paul Ryan, Ted Cruz, John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, Jim DeMint, and Reince Priebus, and many others-American Carnage takes us behind the scenes of this tumultuous period as we've never seen it before and establishes Tim Alberta as the premier chronicler of this political era.||1 online resource||324.273409|ebook - ebook|07/16/2019|2019-07-16|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062896360?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vwSdDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

TLS From one of our leading experts on disinformation, the incredible true story of the complex and largely forgotten WWII propagandist Sefton Delmer - and what we can learn from him today. In the summer of 1941, Hitler and his allies ruled Europe from the Atlantic to the Black Sea. Britain was struggling to combat the powerful Nazi propaganda machine, which crowed victory and smeared its enemies. However, inside Germany, there was one notable voice of dissent from the very heart of the military machine - Der Chef, a German whose radio broadcasts skilfully questioned Nazi doctrine. He had access to high-ranking military secrets and spoke of internal rebellion. His listeners included German soldiers and citizens. But what these audiences didn't know was that Der Chef was a fiction, a character created by the British propagandist Sefton Delmer, just one player in his vast counter-propaganda cabaret, a unique weapon in the war. As author Peter Pomerantsev uncovers Delmer's story, he is called into a wartime propaganda effort of his own: the global response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. This book is the story of Delmer and his modern-day investigator, as they each embark on their own quest to seduce and inspire the passions of supporters and enemies, and to turn the tide of information wars.|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||940.5341|ebook - ebook|03/05/2024|2024-03-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780571366378?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mrboEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Whitmore.|Jesus of Nazareth|Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI|Pope Benedict XVI|Jesus Christ Biography., Jesus Christ History of doctrines., Jesus Christ Influence., Bible. Gospels Theology., Nonfiction., Religion & Spirituality., Electronic books.|Religion|The momentous third and final volume in the Pope's international bestselling Jesus of Nazareth trilogy, detailing how the stories of Jesus' infancy and childhood are as relevant today as they were two thousand years ago.In 2007, Joseph Ratzinger published his first book as Pope Benedict XVI in order to 'make known the figure and message of Jesus'. Now the Pope focuses exclusively on the Gospel accounts of Jesus' life as a child. The root of these stories is the experience of hope found in the birth of Jesus and the affirmation of surrender and service embodied in his parents, Joseph and Mary. This is a story of longing and seeking, as demonstrated by the Magi searching for the redemption offered by the birth of a new king. It is a story of sacrifice and trusting completely in the wisdom of God as seen in the faith of Simeon, the just and the devout man of Jerusalem, when he is in the presence of the Christ child. Ultimately, Jesus' life and message is a story for today, one that speaks to the restlessness of the human heart searching for the sole truth which alone leads to profound joy and freedom. This ostensibly simple message is also the most profound challenge to the individual human being at a time of unprecedented turbulence and change.There is no greater vocation for a Pope than to preach the Gospel and this is what in this book Pope Benedict has done with conviction and urgency. This new book is a masterpiece of its kind.||1 online resource||232|ebook - ebook|11/21/2012|2012-11-21|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781408194546?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VynVcob27GkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

North Korea is one of the most troubled societies on earth. The country's 24 million people live under a violent dictatorship led by a single family, which relentlessly pursues the development of nuclear arms, which periodically incites risky military clashes with the larger, richer, liberal South, and which forces each and every person to play a role in the theater state even as it pays little more than lip service to the wellbeing of the overwhelming majority. With this deeply anachronistic system eventually failed in the 1990s, it triggered a famine that decimated the countryside and obliterated the lives of many hundreds of thousands of people. However, it also changed life forever for those who survived. A lawless form of marketization came to replace the iron rice bowl of work in state companies, and the Orwellian mind control of the Korean Workers' Party was replaced for many by dreams of trade and profit. A new North Korea Society was born from the horrors of the era-one that is more susceptible to outside information than ever before with the advent of k-pop and video-carrying USB sticks. This is the North Korean society that is described in this book. In seven fascinating chapters the authors explore what life is actually like in modern North Korea today for the ordinary man and woman on the street. They interview experts and tap a broad variety of sources to bring a startling new insider's view of North Korean society-from members of Pyongyang's ruling families to defectors from different periods and regions, to diplomats and NGOs with years of experience in the country, to cross-border traders from neighboring China, and textual accounts appearing in English, Korean and Chinese sources. The resulting stories reveal the horror as well as the innovation and humor which abound in this fascinating country.||1 online resource||951.930|ebook - ebook|04/14/2015|2015-04-14|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781462915125?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l-1pBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Surprise . . . your target. Kill . . . your enemy. Vanish . . . without a trace.   When diplomacy fails, and war is unwise, the president calls on the CIA's Special Activities Division, a highly-classified branch of the CIA and the most effective, black operations force in the world. Originally known as the president's guerrilla warfare corps, SAD conducts risky and ruthless operations that have evolved over time to defend America from its enemies. Almost every American president since World War II has asked the CIA to conduct sabotage, subversion and, yes, assassination. With unprecedented access to forty-two men and women who proudly and secretly worked on CIA covert operations from the dawn of the Cold War to the present day, along with declassified documents and deep historical research, Pulitzer Prize finalist Annie Jacobsen unveils - like never before - a complex world of individuals working in treacherous environments populated with killers, connivers, and saboteurs. Despite Hollywood notions of off-book operations and external secret hires, covert action is actually one piece in a colossal foreign policy machine. Written with the pacing of a thriller,  Surprise, Kill, Vanish  brings to vivid life the sheer pandemonium and chaos, as well as the unforgettable human will to survive and the intellectual challenge of not giving up hope that define paramilitary and intelligence work. Jacobsen's exclusive interviews - with members of the CIA's Senior Intelligence Service (equivalent to the Pentagon's generals), its counterterrorism chiefs, targeting officers, and Special Activities Division's Ground Branch operators who conduct today's close-quarters killing operations around the world - reveal, for the first time, the enormity of this shocking, controversial, and morally complex terrain. Is the CIA's paramilitary army America's weaponized strength, or a liability to its principled standing in the world? Every operation reported in this book, however unsettling, is legal.||1 online resource||327.1273009|ebook - ebook|05/14/2019|2019-05-14|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780316441407?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OXltDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Tuchman defines folly as the pursuit by government of policies contrary to their own interests, despite the availability of feasible alternatives. In brilliant detail, Tuchman illuminates four decisive turning points in history that illustrate the very heights of folly: the Trojan War, the breakup of the Holy See provoked by the Renaissance popes, the loss of the American colonies by Britain's George III, and the United States' own persistent mistakes in Vietnam.

In the last two decades, however, the re-emergence of China as a major great power has called into question the geopolitical future of the region and raised the specter of renewed of great power competition. As the eminent China scholar David Shambaugh explains in  Where Great Powers Meet , the United States and China are engaged in a broad-gauged and global competition for power. While this competition ranges across the entire world, it is centered in Asia, and in this book, Shambaugh focuses the ten countries that comprise Southeast Asia. The United States and China constantly vie for position and influence in this enormously significant region-and the outcome of this contest will do much to determine whether Asia leaves the American orbit after seven decades and falls into a new Chinese sphere of influence. Just as importantly, to the extent that there is a global power transition occurring from the US to China, the fate of Southeast Asia will be a good indicator. Presently, both powers bring important assets to bear. The US continues to possess a depth and breadth of security ties, soft power, and direct investment across the region that empirically outweigh China's. For its part, China has more diplomatic influence, much greater trade, and geographic proximity. In assessing the likelihood of a regional power transition, Shambaugh at how ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and the countries within it maneuver between the United States and China and the degree to which they align with one or the other power.||1 online resource||327.59051|ebook - ebook|11/01/2020|2020-11-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780190914981?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZfkFEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

But who is Xi really, and what is his vision for China's future? And, crucially, what does that mean for the rest of the world?|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||951.0612092|ebook - ebook|05/26/2022|2022-05-26|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781785789397?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8b9ZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

As historian Howard Zinn shows, many of our country's greatest battles—the fights for a fair wage, an eight-hour workday, child-labor laws, health and safety standards, universal suffrage, women's rights, racial equality—were carried out at the grassroots level, against bloody resistance.Covering Christopher Columbus's arrival through President Clinton's first term, A People's History of the United States, which was nominated for the American Book Award in 1981, features insightful analysis of the most important events in our history.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|11/17/2015|2015-11-17|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062466679?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KBueCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Howard W French.||French, Howard W.|French, Howard W.||Nonfiction., Slave trade., International relations., History, Modern., African diaspora., History, Modern., African diaspora History., Slave trade Africa, West History., African American Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., History., Africa Relations Europe History., West Africa., Europe., Africa., Africa History., Europe Relations Africa History., Electronic books., Informational works., History.||Revealing the central yet intentionally obliterated role of Africa in the creation of modernity, Born in Blackness vitally reframes our understanding of world history.    Traditional accounts of the making of the modern world afford a place of primacy to European history. Some credit the fifteenth-century Age of Discovery and the maritime connection it established between West and East; others the accidental unearthing of the New World. Still others point to the development of the scientific method, or the spread of Judeo-Christian beliefs; and so on, ad infinitum. The history of Africa, by contrast, has long been relegated to the remote outskirts of our global story. What if, instead, we put Africa and Africans at the very center of our thinking about the origins of modernity?   In a sweeping narrative spanning more than six centuries, Howard W. French does just that, for Born in Blackness vitally reframes the story of medieval and emerging Africa, demonstrating how the economic ascendancy of Europe, the anchoring of democracy in the West, and the fulfillment of so-called Enlightenment ideals all grew out of Europe's dehumanizing engagement with the dark continent. In fact, French reveals, the first impetus for the Age of Discovery was not-as we are so often told, even today-Europe's yearning for ties with Asia, but rather its centuries-old desire to forge a trade in gold with legendarily rich Black societies sequestered away in the heart of West Africa.   Creating a historical narrative that begins with the commencement of commercial relations between Portugal and Africa in the fifteenth century and ends with the onset of World War II, Born in Blackness interweaves precise historical detail with poignant, personal reportage. In so doing, it dramatically retrieves the lives of major African historical figures, from the unimaginably rich medieval emperors who traded with the Near East and beyond, to the Kongo sovereigns who heroically battled seventeenth-century European powers, to the ex-slaves who liberated Haitians from bondage and profoundly altered the course of American history.   While French cogently demonstrates the centrality of Africa to the rise of the modern world, Born in Blackness becomes, at the same time, a far more significant narrative, one that reveals a long-concealed history of trivialization and, more often, elision in depictions of African history throughout the last five hundred years. As French shows, the achievements of sovereign African nations and their now-far-flung peoples have time and again been etiolated and deliberately erased from modern history. As the West ascended, their stories-siloed and piecemeal-were swept into secluded corners, thus setting the stage for the hagiographic rise of the West theories that have endured to this day.   Capacious and compelling (Laurent Dubois), Born in Blackness is epic history on the grand scale. In the lofty tradition of bold, revisionist narratives, it reframes the story of gold and tobacco, sugar and cotton-and of the greatest commodity of them all, the twelve million people who were brought in chains from Africa to the New World, whose reclaimed lives shed a harsh light on our present world.||1 online resource||960.22|ebook - ebook|10/12/2021||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781631495830?s=MD|

Brant Pitre.|Jesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist|Pitre, Brant|Pitre, Brant.|Brant Pitre|Nonfiction., Religion & Spirituality., Electronic books.|Religion|In recent years, Christians everywhere are rediscovering the Jewish roots of their faith. Every year at Easter time, many believers now celebrate Passover meals (known as Seders) seeking to understand exactly what happened at Jesus' final Passover, the night before he was crucified.  Jesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist shines fresh light on the Last Supper by looking at it through Jewish eyes. Using his in-depth knowledge of the Bible and ancient Judaism, Dr. Brant Pitre answers questions such as: What was the Passover like at the time of Jesus? What were the Jewish hopes for the Messiah? What was Jesus' purpose in instituting the Eucharist during the feast of Passover? And, most important of all, what did Jesus mean when he said, This is my body... This is my blood?To answer these questions, Pitre explores ancient Jewish beliefs about the Passover of the Messiah, the miraculous Manna from heaven, and the mysterious Bread of the Presence. As he shows, these three keys-the Passover, the Manna, and the Bread of the Presence-have the power to unlock the original meaning of the Eucharistic words of Jesus. Along the way, Pitre also explains how Jesus united the Last Supper to his death on Good Friday and his Resurrection on Easter Sunday. Inspiring and informative, Jesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist is a groundbreaking work that is sure to illuminate one of the greatest mysteries of the Christian faith: the mystery of Jesus' presence in the breaking of the bread.||1 online resource||234.163|ebook - ebook|02/15/2011|2011-02-15|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780385531856?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t4EaqOT4nKUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

We need to belong to groups. In many parts of the world, the group identities that matter most - the ones that people will kill and die for - are ethnic, religious, sectarian, or clan-based. But because America tends to see the world in terms of nation-states engaged in great ideological battles - Capitalism vs. Communism, Democracy vs. Authoritarianism, the Free World vs. the Axis of Evil - we are often spectacularly blind to the power of tribal politics. Time and again this blindness has undermined American foreign policy.   In the Vietnam War, viewing the conflict through Cold War blinders, we never saw that most of Vietnam's capitalists were members of the hated Chinese minority. Every pro-free-market move we made helped turn the Vietnamese people against us. In Iraq, we were stunningly dismissive of the hatred between that country's Sunnis and Shias. If we want to get our foreign policy right - so as to not be perpetually caught off guard and fighting unwinnable wars - the United States has to come to grips with political tribalism abroad.  Just as Washington's foreign policy establishment has been blind to the power of tribal politics outside the country, so too have American political elites been oblivious to the group identities that matter most to ordinary Americans - and that are tearing the United States apart. As the stunning rise of Donald Trump laid bare, identity politics have seized both the American left and right in an especially dangerous, racially inflected way. In America today, every group feels threatened: whites and blacks, Latinos and Asians, men and women, liberals and conservatives, and so on. There is a pervasive sense of collective persecution and discrimination. On the left, this has given rise to increasingly radical and exclusionary rhetoric of privilege and cultural appropriation. On the right, it has fueled a disturbing rise in xenophobia and white nationalism.   In characteristically persuasive style, Amy Chua argues that America must rediscover a national identity that transcends our political tribes. Enough false slogans of unity, which are just another form of divisiveness. It is time for a more difficult unity that acknowledges the reality of group differences and fights the deep inequities that divide us.||1 online resource||327|ebook - ebook|02/20/2018|2018-02-20|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780399562860?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EoMqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Adrian Goldsworthy.|The Eagle and the Lion|Goldsworthy, Adrian|Goldsworthy, Adrian.|Adrian Goldsworthy|Nonfiction., History., Military., Electronic books.|History|The epic story of the imperial rivalry between two of the greatest empires of the ancient world – Parthian and Persian – and how they rose and eventually fell.  The Roman empire shaped the culture of the western world against which all other great powers are compared. Stretching from the north of Britain to the Sahara, and from the Atlantic coast to the Euphrates, it imposed peace and prosperity on an unprecedented scale. However, the exception lay in the east, where the Parthian and then Persian empires ruled over great cities and the trade routes to mysterious lands beyond. This was the place Alexander the Great had swept through, creating a dream of glory and conquest which tantalised Greeks and Romans alike. Caesar, Mark Antony and a long succession of emperors longed to follow in Alexander's footsteps. All failed. Only here did the Roman empire slow down and eventually stop, unable to go any further. Following seven centuries of conflict that, ultimately, neither Rome nor Persia would win,  The Eagle and the Lion  delves into the clash, context and journeys of these entities of great power and the people caught in their wider struggle.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|07/06/2023|2023-07-06|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781838931971?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V9i0EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

But for the Asian world the Korean War was a generations-long struggle that still haunts contemporary events. With access to new evidence and secret materials from both here and abroad, including an archive of captured North Korean documents, Bruce Cumings reveals the war as it was actually fought. He describes its origin as a civil war, preordained long before the first shots were fired in June 1950 by lingering fury over Japan's occupation of Korea from 1910 to 1945. Cumings then shares the neglected history of America's post--World War II occupation of Korea, reveals untold stories of bloody insurgencies and rebellions, and tells of the United States officially entering the action on the side of the South, exposing as never before the appalling massacres and atrocities committed on all sides.Elegantly written and blisteringly honest, The Korean War is, like the war it illuminates, brief, devastating, and essential.||1 online resource||951.9042|ebook - ebook|07/27/2010||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780679603788?s=MD|

The epochal shift toward neoliberalism-a web of related policies that, broadly speaking, reduced the footprint of government in society and reassigned economic power to private market forces-that began in the United States and Great Britain in the late 1970s fundamentally changed the world. Today, the word neoliberal is often used to condemn a broad swath of policies, from prizing free market principles over people to advancing privatization programs in developing nations around the world. To be sure, neoliberalism has contributed to a number of alarming trends, not least of which has been a massive growth in income inequality. Yet as the eminent historian Gary Gerstle argues in The Rise and Fall of the Neoliberal Order, these indictments fail to reckon with the full contours of what neoliberalism was and why its worldview had such persuasive hold on both the right and the left for three decades. As he shows, the neoliberal order that emerged in America in the 1970s fused ideas of deregulation with personal freedoms, open borders with cosmopolitanism, and globalization with the promise of increased prosperity for all. Along with tracing how this worldview emerged in America and grew to dominate the world, Gerstle explores the previously unrecognized extent to which its triumph was facilitated by the collapse of the Soviet Union and its communist allies. He is also the first to chart the story of the neoliberal order's fall, originating in the failed reconstruction of Iraq and Great Recession of the Bush years and culminating in the rise of Trump and a reinvigorated Bernie Sanders-led American left in the 2010s. An indispensable and sweeping re-interpretation of the last fifty years, this book illuminates how the ideology of neoliberalism became so infused in the daily life of an era, while probing what remains of that ideology and its political programs as America enters an uncertain future.||1 online resource||320.510973|ebook - ebook|03/01/2022|2022|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780197519653?s=MD|

It is, by turns, gripping and shocking and sheds completely new light on the most important intelligence alliance in the world' -    Tim Shipman,   author of   All Out War     The Secret History of The Five Eyes: The untold story of the international spy network,   is a riveting and exclusive narrative of the most powerful and least understood intelligence alliance, which has been steeped in secrecy since its formation in 1956.  Richard Kerbaj, an award-winning investigative journalist and filmmaker, bypasses the usual censorship channels to tell the definitive account of authoritative but unauthorised stories of the Western world's most powerful but least known intelligence alliance made up of the US, Britain, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. As Kerbaj shows, spy stories are never better than when they are true - and these span from 1930s Nazi spy rings to the most recent developments in Ukraine and China. Through personal interviews with world leaders - including British Prime Ministers Theresa May and David Cameron - and more than 100 intelligence officials, this book explores the complex personalities who helped shape the Five Eyes. They include a Scotland Yard detective who became a spymaster and inspired the first exchanges between MI5 and the FBI. An American home economics teacher who helped create one of the most effective programmes to counter Soviet espionage. The CIA's lone officer in Budapest during the Hungarian Revolution. GCHQ's chief during the Edward Snowden intelligence leak. And the Australian politician turned diplomat whose tip-off to the FBI instigated the inquiry into Russia's meddling in the US presidential contest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Richard Kerbaj is able to draw from deep inside the secret corridors of power and his unparalleled access spans all 5 countries. Some of the people he has interviewed include former GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban, CIA director General David Petraeus, MI5 director-general Eliza Manningham-Buller, NSA director Admiral Mike Rogers, British National Security Advisor Kim Darroch, ASIO chief Mike Burgess, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service's chief Richard Fadden, and Ciaran Martin, the official who oversaw Britain's assessments on whether the Chinese telecoms firm, Huawei, should have had a role in the creation of the UK's 5G network.  This page-turning book will lift the lid on spy stories from across the English-speaking world, question the future of the alliance, and our place within it.|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||327.120|ebook - ebook|09/01/2022|2022-09-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781789465563?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rwV4EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Tom Segev.|1949 the First Israelis|Segev, Tom|Segev, Tom.|Tom Segev|Nonfiction., History., Politics., Sociology.|Political Science|Renowned historian Tom Segev strips away national myths to present a critical and clear-eyed chronicle of the year immediately following Israel's foundation.   Required reading for all who want to understand the Arab-Israeli conflict...the best analysis...of the problems of trying to integrate so many people from such diverse cultures into one political body ( The New York Times Book Review ).     Historian and journalist Tom Segev stirred up controversy in Israel upon the first publication of  1949 . It was a landmark book that told a different story of the country's early years, one that wasn't taught in schools or shown in popular culture. Rather than painting the idealized picture of the Israel's founding in 1948, after the wreckage of the Holocaust, Segev reveals gritty underside behind the early years.    The new country of Israel faced challenges on all sides. Day-to-day life was severe, marked by austerity and food shortages; Israeli society was fractured between traditional and secular camps; Jewish immigrants from Middle-Eastern countries faced discrimination and second-class treatment; and clashes between settlers and the Arabs would set the tone for relations for the following decades, hardening attitudes and creating a violent cycle of retaliation.    Drawing on journal entries, letters, declassified government documents, and more,  1949  is a richly detailed look at the friction between the idealism of the Zionist movement and the cold realities of history. Decades after its publication in the United States, Segev's groundbreaking book is still required reading for anyone who wants to understand Israel's past and future.||1 online resource||956.94052|ebook - ebook|08/14/2018|2018-08-14|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781982102074?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YHlJDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Turabian first put her famous guidelines to paper, she could hardly have imagined the world in which today's students would be conducting research. Yet while the ways in which we research and compose papers may have changed, the fundamentals remain the same: writers need to have a strong research question, construct an evidence-based argument, cite their sources, and structure their work in a logical way.  A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations -also known as Turabian-remains one of the most popular books for writers because of its timeless focus on achieving these goals.    This new edition filters decades of expertise into modern standards. While previous editions incorporated digital forms of research and writing, this edition goes even further to build information literacy, recognizing that most students will be doing their work largely or entirely online and on screens. Chapters include updated advice on finding, evaluating, and citing a wide range of digital sources and also recognize the evolving use of software for citation management, graphics, and paper format and submission. The ninth edition is fully aligned with the recently released  Chicago Manual of Style , 17th edition, as well as with the latest edition of  The Craft of Research.     Teachers and users of the previous editions will recognize the familiar three-part structure. Part 1 covers every step of the research and writing process, including drafting and revising. Part 2 offers a comprehensive guide to Chicago's two methods of source citation: notes-bibliography and author-date. Part 3 gets into matters of editorial style and the correct way to present quotations and visual material.   A Manual for Writers  also covers an issue familiar to writers of all levels: how to conquer the fear of tackling a major writing project.    Through eight decades and millions of copies,  A Manual for Writers  has helped generations shape their ideas into compelling research papers.

Trump-by a former CIA analyst considered one of the leading American experts on the North Korean ruler inside and outside the U.S. government   An important book.-James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence    When Kim Jong Un became the leader of North Korea following his father's death in 2011, predictions about his imminent fall were rife. North Korea was isolated, poor, unable to feed its people, and clinging to its nuclear program for legitimacy. Surely this twentysomething with a bizarre haircut and no leadership experience would soon be usurped by his elders. Instead, the opposite happened. Now in his midthirties, Kim Jong Un has solidified his grip on his country and brought the United States and the region to the brink of war. Still, we know so little about him-or how he rules.  Enter former CIA analyst Jung Pak, whose brilliant Brookings Institution essay The Education of Kim Jong Un cemented her status as the go-to authority on the calculating young leader. From the beginning of Kim's reign, Pak has been at the forefront of shaping U.S. policy on North Korea and providing strategic assessments for leadership at the highest levels in the government. Now, in this masterly book, she traces and explains Kim's ascent on the world stage, from his brutal power-consolidating purges to his abrupt pivot toward diplomatic engagement that led to his historic-and still poorly understood-summits with President Trump. She also sheds light on how a top intelligence analyst assesses thorny national security problems: avoiding biases, questioning assumptions, and identifying risks as well as opportunities.  In piecing together Kim's wholly unique life, Pak argues that his personality, perceptions, and preferences are underestimated by Washington policy wonks, who assume he sees the world as they do. As the North Korean nuclear threat grows,  Becoming Kim Jong Un  gives readers the first authoritative, behind-the-scenes look at Kim's character and motivations, creating an insightful biography of the enigmatic man who will likely rule the hermit kingdom for decades-and has already left an indelible imprint on world history.||1 online resource||951.9305209|ebook - ebook|04/28/2020|2020-04-28|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781984819734?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pAOhDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Jack Weatherford.|Genghis Khan and the Quest for God|Weatherford, Jack|Weatherford, Jack.|Jack Weatherford|Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., History., Religion & Spirituality., Electronic books., Electronic book|History|A landmark biography by the New York Times bestselling author of Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World that reveals how Genghis harnessed the power of religion to rule the largest empire the world has ever known. Throughout history the world's greatest conquerors have made their mark not just on the battlefield, but in the societies they have transformed. Genghis Khan conquered by arms and bravery, but he ruled by commerce and religion. He created the world's greatest trading network and drastically lowered taxes for merchants, but he knew that if his empire was going to last, he would need something stronger and more binding than trade. He needed religion. And so, unlike the Christian, Taoist and Muslim conquerors who came before him, he gave his subjects freedom of religion. Genghis lived in the 13th century, but he struggled with many of the same problems we face today: How should one balance religious freedom with the need to reign in fanatics? Can one compel rival religions - driven by deep seated hatred&#8212;to live together in peace?  A celebrated anthropologist whose bestselling Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World radically transformed our understanding of the Mongols and their legacy, Jack Weatherford has spent eighteen years exploring areas of Mongolia closed until the fall of the Soviet Union and researching The Secret History of the Mongols, an astonishing document written in code that was only recently discovered. He pored through archives and found groundbreaking evidence of Genghis's influence on the founding fathers and his essential impact on Thomas Jefferson. Genghis Khan and the Quest for God is a masterpiece of erudition and insight, his most personal and resonant work.From the Hardcover edition.||1 online resource||323.44209|ebook - ebook|10/25/2016|2016-10-25|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780735221161?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AWF_CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Yet we are not living in more just and democratic societies as a result. IF WE BURN   is a stirring work of history built around a single, vital question: How did so many mass protests lead to the opposite of what they asked for?     From the so-called Arab Spring to Gezi Park in Turkey, from Ukraine's Euromaidan to student rebellions in Chile and Hong Kong, acclaimed journalist Vincent Bevins provides a blow-by-blow account of street movements and their consequences, recounted in gripping detail. He draws on four years of research and hundreds of interviews conducted around the world, as well as his own strange experiences in Brazil, where a progressive-led protest explosion led to an extreme-right government that torched the Amazon.     Careful investigation reveals that conventional wisdom on revolutionary change is gravely misguided. In this groundbreaking study of an extraordinary chain of events, protesters and major actors look back on successes and defeats, offering urgent lessons for the future.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|10/03/2023|2023-10-03|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781541788961?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6GiIEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Modi managed to seduce a substantial number of citizens by promising them development and polarizing the electorate along ethno-religious lines. Both facets of this national-populism found expression in a highly personalized political style as Modi related directly to the voters through all kinds of channels of communication in order to saturate the public space. Drawing on original interviews conducted across India, Christophe Jaffrelot shows how Modi's government has moved India toward a new form of democracy, an ethnic democracy that equates the majoritarian community with the nation and relegates Muslims and Christians to second-class citizens who are harassed by vigilante groups. He discusses how the promotion of Hindu nationalism has resulted in attacks against secularists, intellectuals, universities, and NGOs. Jaffrelot explains how the political system of India has acquired authoritarian features for other reasons, too. Eager to govern not only in New Delhi, but also in the states, the government has centralized power at the expense of federalism and undermined institutions that were part of the checks and balances, including India's Supreme Court.  Modi's India  is a sobering account of how a once-vibrant democracy can go wrong when a government backed by popular consent suppresses dissent while growing increasingly intolerant of ethnic and religious minorities.||1 online resource||954.0533|ebook - ebook|08/03/2021|2021-08-03|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780691223094?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N7USEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

He blazed through a decade at Manchester United, scoring 126 goals in 366 appearances for the Red Devils.The Norwegian striker became famous for his uncanny ability to score in the dying minutes of important games, often coming on as a 'super-sub' - most famously scoring the last gasp winner against Bayern Munich to win United the 1999 Champions League, and secure the famed trophy Treble - before moving on to new adventures as a manager in Norway, following a career-ending injury.And at the end of 2018, the circle completed itself: Ole returned to Manchester United, this time as the caretaker manager, stepping into the breach after the unhappy departure of Jose Mourinho, and winning eight games in a row to restore a beleaguered United to stunning form. The Old Trafford faithful are once more singing his name loud and proud.In this informative and insightful book, sports writer Ian MacLeay charts the highs and lows of the Baby Faced Assassin's career, to provide an in-depth look at both the man and the striker who will go down forever as an icon in Manchester United history.

Jimmy Carter.|Palestine Peace Not Apartheid|Carter, Jimmy|Carter, Jimmy.|Jimmy Carter|Nonfiction., History., Politics., Electronic books.|Political Science|Following his #1 New York Times bestseller, Our Endangered Values, the former president, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, offers an assessment of what must be done to bring permanent peace to Israel with dignity and justice to Palestine. President Carter, who was able to negotiate peace between Israel and Egypt, has remained deeply involved in Middle East affairs since leaving the White House. He has stayed in touch with the major players from all sides in the conflict and has made numerous trips to the Holy Land, most recently as an observer in the Palestinian elections of 2005 and 2006. In this book President Carter shares his intimate knowledge of the history of the Middle East and his personal experiences with the principal actors, and he addresses sensitive political issues many American officials avoid. Pulling no punches, Carter prescribes steps that must be taken for the two states to share the Holy Land without a system of apartheid or the constant fear of terrorism. The general parameters of a long-term, two-state agreement are well known, the president writes. There will be no substantive and permanent peace for any peoples in this troubled region as long as Israel is violating key U.N. resolutions, official American policy, and the international road map for peace by occupying Arab lands and oppressing the Palestinians. Except for mutually agreeable negotiated modifications, Israel's official pre-1967 borders must be honored. As were all previous administrations since the founding of Israel, U.S. government leaders must be in the forefront of achieving this long-delayed goal of a just agreement that both sides can honor. Palestine Peace Not Apartheid is a challenging, provocative, and courageous book.||1 online resource||956.04|ebook - ebook|11/14/2006|2006-11-14|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780743298483?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tWeaLvPweg8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The result was a catastrophic famine, the most lethal in European history. At least five million people died between 1931 and 1933 in the USSR. But instead of sending relief the Soviet state made use of the catastrophe to rid itself of a political problem. In  Red Famine , Anne Applebaum argues that more than three million of those dead were Ukrainians who perished not because they were accidental victims of a bad policy but because the state deliberately set out to kill them. Applebaum proves what has long been suspected: after a series of rebellions unsettled the province, Stalin set out to destroy the Ukrainian peasantry. The state sealed the republic's borders and seized all available food. Starvation set in rapidly, and people ate anything: grass, tree bark, dogs, corpses. In some cases, they killed one another for food. Devastating and definitive,  Red Famine  captures the horror of ordinary people struggling to survive extraordinary evil. Today, Russia, the successor to the Soviet Union, has placed Ukrainian independence in its sights once more.

Donald Trump's surprise electoral victory shattered the fragile understanding between Washington and Beijing, putting the most important relationship of the twenty-first century in the hands of a novice who had bitterly attacked China from the campaign trail. Almost as soon as he entered office, Trump brought to a boil the long-simmering rivalry between the two countries, while also striking up a friendship with Chinese president Xi Jinping - whose manipulations of his American counterpart would undermine the White House's already disjointed response to the historic challenge of a rising China. All the while, Trump's own officials fought to steer U.S. policy from within. By the time the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in Wuhan, Trump's love-hate relationship with Xi had sparked a trade war, while Xi's aggression had pushed the world to the brink of a new Cold War. But their quarrel had also forced a long-overdue reckoning within the United States over China's audacious foreign-influence operations, horrific human rights abuses, and creeping digital despotism. Ironically, this awakening was one of the biggest foreign-policy victories of Trump's fractious term in office. Filled with shocking revelations drawn from Josh Rogin's unparalleled access to top U.S. officials from the White House and deep within the country's foreign policy machine,  Chaos Under Heaven  reveals an administration at war with itself during perhaps our most urgent hour.||1 online resource||327.7305|ebook - ebook|04/16/2024|2021-03-09|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780358393832?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AgHrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.- Sun Tzu, The Art of WarCovering more than two thousand years of history, twelve key battles that helped shape today's ChinaThe study of Chinese battles faces many hurdles that include different spelling systems, a haze of seemingly impenetrable names, places, and ideas, and different approaches to recording history. Early indigenous Chinese histories were written by Confucians with an anti­military bias, and used rather laconic phrases to describe battles. These accounts were then transmitted to Jesuit missionaries who shared the Confucian disdain for martial matters. The modern discipline of history developed in the West during a time of particular Chinese weakness and political division, resulting in the lack of parallel material. Decisive Battles in Chinese History by Morgan Deane overcomes these obstacles to present the vast span of recorded Chinese history through key battles, from Maling, fought in 342 BC during the Warring States period, to Hengyang in 1944, which marked the end of major Japanese operations in China. Each of the twelve chapters highlights a significant conflict that selectively focuses on unique Chinese characteristics of the time, including belief systems, ruling ideology, the connection between technology and warfare, military theory, political events and rulers, and foreign policy, including China's eventual interaction with the West. The book pushes back on a variety of ideas and stereotypes, ranging from the Chinese use of gunpowder, their supposedly weak reaction to the West, the viability of the Dynastic Cycle in studying history, the context of Chinese military theory, the exclusivity of martial and cultural spheres, and the uniqueness of Western imperialism. It also offers a groundbreaking reassessment of Mao Zedong's leadership and his impact on the development of guerilla warfare. In a world filled with disturbing reports of conflict and potential warfare, Decisive Battles in Chinese History offers a unique addition to students, historians, and general readers wishing to better understand Chinese history.||1 online resource||355.00951|ebook - ebook|08/15/2018|2018|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781594166273?s=MD|

Fareed Zakaria.|From Wealth to Power|Zakaria, Fareed|Zakaria, Fareed.|Fareed Zakaria|Nonfiction., History., Electronic books.|History|What turns rich nations into great powers? How do wealthy countries begin extending their influence abroad? These questions are vital to understanding one of the most important sources of instability in international politics: the emergence of a new power. In  From Wealth to Power , Fareed Zakaria seeks to answer these questions by examining the most puzzling case of a rising power in modern history-that of the United States. If rich nations routinely become great powers, Zakaria asks, then how do we explain the strange inactivity of the United States in the late nineteenth century? By 1885, the U.S. was the richest country in the world. And yet, by all military, political, and diplomatic measures, it was a minor power. To explain this discrepancy, Zakaria considers a wide variety of cases between 1865 and 1908 when the U.S. considered expanding its influence in such diverse places as Canada, the Dominican Republic, and Iceland. Consistent with the realist theory of international relations, he argues that the President and his administration tried to increase the country's political influence abroad when they saw an increase in the nation's relative economic power. But they frequently had to curtail their plans for expansion, he shows, because they lacked a strong central government that could harness that economic power for the purposes of foreign policy. America was an unusual power-a strong nation with a weak state. It was not until late in the century, when power shifted from states to the federal government and from the legislative to the executive branch, that leaders in Washington could mobilize the nation's resources for international influence. Zakaria's exploration of this tension between national power and state structure will change how we view the emergence of new powers and deepen our understanding of America's exceptional history.||1 online resource||327.730|ebook - ebook|07/26/1999|1999-07-26|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781400829187?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KfFfF9XucUAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

From the time of the Greeks and the Persians clashing in the Mediterranean, sea power has determined world power. To an extent that is often underappreciated, it still does. No one understands this better than Admiral Jim Stavridis. In Sea Power, Admiral Stavridis takes us with him on a tour of the world's oceans from the admiral's chair, showing us how the geography of the oceans has shaped the destiny of nations, and how naval power has in a real sense made the world we live in today, and will shape the world we live in tomorrow.  Not least, Sea Power is marvelous naval history, giving us fresh insight into great naval engagements from the battles of Salamis and Lepanto through to Trafalgar, the Battle of the Atlantic, and submarine conflicts of the Cold War. It is also a keen-eyed reckoning with the likely sites of our next major naval conflicts, particularly the Arctic Ocean, Eastern Mediterranean, and the South China Sea. Finally, Sea Power steps back to take a holistic view of the plagues to our oceans that are best seen that way, from piracy to pollution. When most of us look at a globe, we focus on the shape of the of the seven continents. Admiral Stavridis sees the shapes of the seven seas. After reading Sea Power, you will too. Not since Alfred Thayer Mahan's legendary The Influence of Sea Power upon History have we had such a powerful reckoning with this vital subject.||1 online resource||359.03|ebook - ebook|06/06/2017|2017-06-06|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780735220607?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A-YZDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Exciting and magical.' Damon Hill    'Nick Fry and Ed Gorman take us behind the mysterious and tightly closed doors of F1 to tell the remarkable story of the 2009 season.' Martin Brundle    Foreword by Bernie Ecclestone     The full story of F1's incredible 2009 championship battle has never been told. Until now. In this gripping memoir, Nick Fry, the former CEO of Brawn GP, reveals how he found himself in the driving seat for one of the most incredible journeys in the history of motor sport.   At the end of 2008, Nick, then head of Honda's F1 team, was told by his Japanese bosses that the motor company was pulling out of F1 in thirty days. This bolt from the blue was a disaster for the team's 700 staff, for Ross Brawn, who Nick had recently recruited as chief engineer, and for the drivers, Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello. But in a few short weeks, Nick and Ross would persuade Honda to sell them the company for £1 (plus all the liabilities).   Just thirteen weeks later, the Brawn GP team, led by Nick and Ross, would emerge from these ashes, win the first Grand Prix of the 2009 season, and go on to win the Driver's and the Constructor's Championship, with a borrowed engine, a heavily adapted chassis and, at least initially, no sponsors.  In  Survive. Drive. Win. , Nick gives an up-close-and-personal account of how he and Ross turned disaster into championship glory and laid the foundations for what was to become the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 team. Along the way he gives the inside track on the drivers, the rivalries between teams, on negotiating with Bernie Ecclestone, on hiring and working with two global superstars: Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton - and offers a unique and thrilling perspective on an elite global sport.|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||796.720922|ebook - ebook|10/03/2019|2019-10-03|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781786498915?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3OSdDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Part horror story, part historical document, part memoir, part political tract, this record of one man's suffering gives eyewitness proof to an ongoing sorrowful chapter of modern history.

By 1914 it had been drastically weakened and circled by numerous predators waiting to finish it off. Following the Ottoman decision to join the First World War on the side of the Central Powers the British, French and Russians hatched a plan to finish the Ottomans off: an ambitious and unprecedented invasion of Gallipoli... Eugene Rogan's remarkable book recreates one of the most important but poorly understood fronts of the First World War. Despite fighting back with great skill and ferocity against the Allied onslaught and humiliating the British both at Gallipoli and in Mesopotamia (Iraq), the Ottomans were ultimately defeated, clearing the way for the making, for better or worse, of a new Middle East which has endured to the present.||1 online resource||949.6101|ebook - ebook|02/26/2015|2015-02-26|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780141968704?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tP-4BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Yet sometime near the end of the century, censors cut their story from The Secret History of the Mongols, leaving only a hint of a father's legacy for his daughters. The queens of the Silk Route turned their father's conquests into the world's first truly international empire, fostering trade, education, and religion throughout their territories and creating an economic system that stretched from the Pacific to the Mediterranean. Outlandish stories of these powerful queens trickled out of the Empire, shocking the citizens of Europe and and the Islamic world.After Genghis Khan's death in 1227, conflicts erupted between his daughters and his daughters-in-law; what began as a war between powerful women soon became a war against women in power as brother turned against sister and son against mother. At the end of this epic struggle, the dynasty of the Mongol queens had seemingly been extinguished forever, as even their names were erased from the historical record.  Two centuries later, one of the most unusual and important warrior queens of history-Queen Mandhuhai-arose to avenge the wrongs, rescue the tattered shreds of the Mongol Empire, and restore order to a shattered world. She led her soldiers through victory after victory. In her thirties she married a seventeen-year-old prince, and she bore eight children in the midst of a career spent fighting the Ming Dynasty of China on one side and a series of Muslim warlords on the other. Her unprecedented success on the battlefield provoked the Chinese into the most frantic and expensive phase of wall building in history. Charging into battle even while pregnant, she fought to reassemble the Mongol Nation of Genghis Khan and to preserve it for her own children to rule in peace.Despite their mystery and the efforts to erase them from our collective memory, the deeds of these Mongol queens inspired great artists from Chaucer and Milton to Goethe and Puccini. And so their stories live on today. With The Secret History of the Mongol Queens, Jack Weatherford restores the queens' missing chapter to the annals of history.From the Hardcover edition.||1 online resource||950.20922|ebook - ebook|02/16/2010|2010-02-16|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780307589361?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z0-i93wTDJUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Billy Graham.||Graham, Billy|Graham, Billy.||Nonfiction., Religion & Spirituality., Electronic books., Electronic book||The Final Chapter From Billy Graham  While his earthly vision dims, the glory of heaven is illuminated as Billy Graham, the beloved evangelist, shares from his past, and his present, the reality of eternity. Although Billy Graham may no longer preach from the stadiums of the world, in this book you will sense his heart still beats strong with the resounding assurance that he will spend eternity with Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. In Where I Am, Mr. Graham invites and strongly encourages all of us to contemplate our eternal hope.  When asked, Where is Heaven? Mr. Graham has wisely replied, Heaven is where Jesus Christ is, and I'm going to Him soon. The greatest promise ever given to the human race came from the lips of our Redeemer when Jesus said, Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me...I go to prepare a place for you...I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also (John 14:1–3). Just after his ninety-fifth birthday, Mr. Graham proclaimed with resolve, When I die, tell others that I've gone to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ—that's where I am. Flap Copy: As our nation and world travail in the midst of political, economic, and cultural uncertainties, we can find comfort in the hope that comes from the unchanging truth of God's Word. Whether talking with a US president, a world leader, or the common man or being interviewed on network television, Billy Graham has always begun his answers with The Bible says... In Where I Am, Mr. Graham shares what the Bible has to say about eternity from all of its sixty-six books; messages of truth, warning, love, and the certainty of the future, all gleaned by a man who would like to be remembered solely as a preacher of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Each short chapter examines the reality that each of us chooses where to spend life after death: Heaven or Hell. From the Old Testament writer who composed Show me Your ways, O Lord (Psalm 25:4) to the New Testament writer who penned the words of Jesus, Whoever believes in [Me] should not perish (John 3:16), there is hope for anyone who puts his or her faith and trust in the One who gives us the promise, Where I am, there you may be also (14:3).||1 online resource||236.2|ebook - ebook|09/29/2015||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780718075828?s=MD|

The rules, policies, and institutions that have guided the world since World War II have largely run their course. Respect for sovereignty alone cannot uphold order in an age defined by global challenges from terrorism and the spread of nuclear weapons to climate change and cyberspace. Meanwhile, great power rivalry is returning. Weak states pose problems just as confounding as strong ones. The United States remains the world's strongest country, but American foreign policy has at times made matters worse, both by what the U.S. has done and by what it has failed to do. The Middle East is in chaos, Asia is threatened by China's rise and a reckless North Korea, and Europe, for decades the world's most stable region, is now anything but. As Richard Haass explains, the election of Donald Trump and the unexpected vote for Brexit signals that many in modern democracies reject important aspects of globalization, including borders open to trade and immigrants. In A World in Disarray, Haass argues for an updated global operating system-call it world order 2.0-that reflects the reality that power is widely distributed and that borders count for less. One critical element of this adjustment will be adopting a new approach to sovereignty, one that embraces its obligations and responsibilities as well as its rights and protections. Haass also details how the U.S. should act towards China and Russia, as well as in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. He suggests, too, what the country should do to address its dysfunctional politics, mounting debt, and the lack of agreement on the nature of its relationship with the world. A World in Disarray is a wise examination, one rich in history, of the current world, along with how we got here and what needs doing. Haass shows that the world cannot have stability or prosperity without the United States, but that the United States cannot be a force for global stability and prosperity without its politicians and citizens reaching a new understanding.||1 online resource||327.7300905|ebook - ebook|01/10/2017|2017-01-10|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780399562372?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VEkKDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Darkly fascinating. A tale that will keep you up at night. - John Carreyrou, #1 bestselling author of  Bad Blood   From   New York Times     finance editor David Enrich, a   searing exposé of the most scandalous bank in the world, revealing its shadowy ties to Donald Trump, Putin's Russia, and Nazi Germany   On a rainy Sunday in 2014, a senior executive at Deutsche Bank was found hanging in his London apartment. Bill Broeksmit had helped build the 150-year-old financial institution into a global colossus, and his sudden death was a mystery, made more so by the bank's efforts to deter investigation. Broeksmit, it turned out, was a man who knew too much.  In Dark Towers, award-winning journalist David Enrich reveals the truth about Deutsche Bank and its epic path of devastation. Tracing the bank's history back to its propping up of a default-prone American developer in the 1880s, helping the Nazis build Auschwitz, and wooing Eastern Bloc authoritarians, he shows how in the 1990s, via a succession of hard-charging executives, Deutsche made a fateful decision to pursue Wall Street riches, often at the expense of ethics and the law.  Soon, the bank was manipulating markets, violating international sanctions to aid terrorist regimes, scamming investors, defrauding regulators, and laundering money for Russian oligarchs. Ever desperate for an American foothold, Deutsche also started doing business with a self-promoting real estate magnate nearly every other bank in the world deemed too dangerous to touch: Donald Trump. Over the next twenty years, Deutsche executives loaned billions to Trump, the Kushner family, and an array of scandal-tarred clients, including convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.   Dark Towers is the never-before-told saga of how Deutsche Bank became the global face of financial recklessness and criminality-the corporate equivalent of a weapon of mass destruction. It is also the story of a man who was consumed by fear of what he'd seen at the bank-and his son's obsessive search for the secrets he kept.||1 online resource||332.150943|ebook - ebook|04/16/2024|2020-02-18|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062878823?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GWOIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Take Europe's oldest city, for example: Athens has a youthful vibe and buzzing nightlife, where upmarket restaurants stand alongside traditional grill eateries and old-school ouzeris jostle with the trendy cocktail bars of up-and-coming urban neighbourhoods.

Outdoor adventurers can trek the dramatic Víkos and Loúsios gorges and climb the craggy peaks of Mount Olympos.

Fought over a period of three decades, the conflict drew in all the world's powers and saw two of them--first France, then the United States--attempt to subdue the revolutionary Vietnamese forces. For France, the defeat marked the effective end of her colonial empire, while for America the war left a gaping wound in the body politic that remains open to this day.   How did it happen? Tapping into newly accessible diplomatic archives in several nations and making full use of the published literature, distinguished scholar Fredrik Logevall traces the path that led two Western nations to lose their way in Vietnam. Embers of War opens in 1919 at the Versailles Peace Conference, where a young Ho Chi Minh tries to deliver a petition for Vietnamese independence to President Woodrow Wilson.

Based on over five hundred interviews, Following the Leader offers a rare glimpse into how the attitudes and ideas of those at the top have evolved over the past four decades. Here China's rulers explain their strategies and ideas for moving the nation forward, share their reflections on matters of leadership and policy, and discuss the challenges that keep them awake at night.?As the Chinese Communist Party installs its new president, Xi Jinping, for a presumably ten-year term, questions abound. How will the country move forward as its explosive rate of economic growth begins to slow? How does it plan to deal with domestic and international calls for political reform and to cope with an aging population, not to mention an increasingly fragmented bureaucracy and society? In this insightful book we learn how China's leaders see the nation's political future, as well as about its global strategic influence.||1 online resource||320.951|ebook - ebook|12/20/2013|2014-02-03|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780520957398?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5fMlAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Did it crash there? Or did it fly on to land safely in disputed lands of Central Asia, or the top-secret CIA 'black site' on Diego Garcia?Data from the Rolls-Royce engines tracked by Inmarsat was said to indicate that it might have ditched in the furthest reaches of the South Indian Ocean.

Herbert P Bix.|Hirohito And The Making Of Modern Japan|Bix, Herbert P.|Bix, Herbert P.|Herbert P. Bix|Nonfiction., History., Electronic books.|Biography & Autobiography|Winner of the Pulitzer PrizeIn this groundbreaking biography of the Japanese emperor Hirohito, Herbert P. Bix offers the first complete, unvarnished look at the enigmatic leader whose sixty-three-year reign ushered Japan into the modern world. Never before has the full life of this controversial figure been revealed with such clarity and vividness. Bix shows what it was like to be trained from birth for a lone position at the apex of the nation's political hierarchy and as a revered symbol of divine status. Influenced by an unusual combination of the Japanese imperial tradition and a modern scientific worldview, the young emperor gradually evolves into his preeminent role, aligning himself with the growing ultranationalist movement, perpetuating a cult of religious emperor worship, resisting attempts to curb his power, and all the while burnishing his image as a reluctant, passive monarch. Here we see Hirohito as he truly was: a man of strong will and real authority.Supported by a vast array of previously untapped primary documents, Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan is perhaps most illuminating in lifting the veil on the mythology surrounding the emperor's impact on the world stage. Focusing closely on Hirohito's interactions with his advisers and successive Japanese governments, Bix sheds new light on the causes of the China War in 1937 and the start of the Asia-Pacific War in 1941. And while conventional wisdom has had it that the nation's increasing foreign aggression was driven and maintained not by the emperor but by an elite group of Japanese militarists, the reality, as witnessed here, is quite different. Bix documents in detail the strong, decisive role Hirohito played in wartime operations, from the takeover of Manchuria in 1931 through the attack on Pearl Harbor and ultimately the fateful decision in 1945 to accede to an unconditional surrender. In fact, the emperor stubbornly prolonged the war effort and then used the horrifying bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, together with the Soviet entrance into the war, as his exit strategy from a no-win situation. From the moment of capitulation, we see how American and Japanese leaders moved to justify the retention of Hirohito as emperor by whitewashing his wartime role and reshaping the historical consciousness of the Japanese people. The key to this strategy was Hirohito's alliance with General MacArthur, who helped him maintain his stature and shed his militaristic image, while MacArthur used the emperor as a figurehead to assist him in converting Japan into a peaceful nation. Their partnership ensured that the emperor's image would loom large over the postwar years and later decades, as Japan began to make its way in the modern age and struggled -- as it still does -- to come to terms with its past.Until the very end of a career that embodied the conflicting aims of Japan's development as a nation, Hirohito remained preoccupied with politics and with his place in history. Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan provides the definitive account of his rich life and legacy. Meticulously researched and utterly engaging, this book is proof that the history of twentieth-century Japan cannot be understood apart from the life of its most remarkable and enduring leader.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|10/13/2009|2009-10-13|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780061860478?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zjmVltzm1kYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In this bold examination of the Israeli-American relationship, Walter Russell Mead demolishes the myths that both pro-Zionists and anti-Zionists have fostered over the years. He makes clear that Zionism has always been a divisive subject in the American Jewish community, and that American Christians have often been the most fervent supporters of a Jewish state, citing examples from the time of J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller to the present day. He spotlights the almost forgotten story of left-wing support for Zionism, arguing that Eleanor Roosevelt and liberal New Dealers had more influence on President Truman's Israel policy than the American Jewish community-and that Stalin's influence was more decisive than Truman's in Israel's struggle for independence. Mead shows how Israel's rise in the Middle East helped kindle both the modern evangelical movement and the Sunbelt coalition that carried Reagan into the White House. Highlighting the real sources of Israel's support across the American political spectrum, he debunks the legend of the so-called Israel lobby. And, he describes the aspects of American culture that make it hostile to anti-Semitism and warns about the danger to that tradition of tolerance as our current culture wars heat up. With original analysis and in lively prose, Mead illuminates the American-Israeli relationship, how it affects contemporary politics, and how it will influence the future of both that relationship and American life.||1 online resource||327.7305694|ebook - ebook|07/05/2022|2022-07-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781101946985?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n6YIDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Japanese subjects, on the other hand, made observations about the background environment...and the different seeings are a clue to profound underlying cognitive differences between Westerners and East Asians. As Professor Nisbett shows in The Geography of Thought people actually think - and even see - the world differently, because of differing ecologies, social structures, philosophies, and educational systems that date back to ancient Greece and China, and that have survived into the modern world. As a result, East Asian thought is holistic - drawn to the perceptual field as a whole, and to relations among objects and events within that field. By comparison to Western modes of reasoning, East Asian thought relies far less on categories, or on formal logic; it is fundamentally dialectic, seeking a middle way between opposing thoughts.

Through their voices, Pilling's Bending Adversity captures the dynamism and diversity of contemporary Japan.Pilling's exploration begins with the 2011 triple disaster of earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear meltdown. His deep reporting reveals both Japan's vulnerabilities and its resilience and pushes him to understand the country's past through cycles of crisis and reconstruction. Japan's survivalist mentality has carried it through tremendous hardship, but is also the source of great destruction: It was the nineteenth-century struggle to ward off colonial intent that resulted in Japan's own imperial endeavor, culminating in the devastation of World War II. Even the postwar economic miracle-the manufacturing and commerce explosion that brought unprecedented economic growth and earned Japan international clout might have been a less pure victory than it seemed. In Bending Adversity Pilling questions what was lost in the country's blind, aborted climb to #1. With the same rigor, he revisits 1990-the year the economic bubble burst, and the beginning of Japan's lost decades-to ask if the turning point might be viewed differently. While financial struggle and national debt are a reality, post-growth Japan has also successfully maintained a stable standard of living and social cohesion. And while life has become less certain, opportunities-in particular for the young and for women-have diversified. Still, Japan is in many ways a country in recovery, working to find a way forward after the events of 2011 and decades of slow growth. Bending Adversity closes with a reflection on what the 2012 reelection of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and his radical antideflation policy, might mean for Japan and its future. Informed throughout by the insights shared by Pilling's many interview subjects, Bending Adversity rigorously engages with the social, spiritual, financial, and political life of Japan to create a more nuanced representation of the oft-misunderstood island nation and its people.The Financial TimesDavid Pilling quotes a visiting MP from northern England, dazzled by Tokyo's lights and awed by its bustling prosperity: 'If this is a recession, I want one.' Not the least of the merits of Pilling's hugely enjoyable and perceptive book on Japan is that he places the denunciations of two allegedly lost decades in the context of what the country is really like and its actual achievements.The Telegraph (UK)Pilling, the Asia editor of the Financial Times, is perfectly placed to be our guide, and his insights are a real rarity when very few Western journalists communicate the essence of the world's third-largest economy in anything but the most superficial ways. Here, there is a terrific selection of interview subjects mixed with great reportage and fact selection... he does get people to say wonderful things. The novelist Haruki Murakami tells him: When we were rich, I hated this country... well-written... valuable.Publishers Weekly (starred):A probing and insightful portrait of contemporary Japan.||1 online resource||952.1|ebook - ebook|03/13/2014|2014-03-13|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780698141216?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qWI2AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Born in tsarist Russia in 1898, she immigrated to America in 1906 and grew up in Milwaukee, where from her earliest years she displayed the political consciousness and organizational skills that would eventually catapult her into the inner circles of Israel's founding generation. Moving to mandatory Palestine in 1921 with her husband, the passionate socialist joined a kibbutz but soon left and was hired at a public works office by the man who would become the great love of her life. A series of public service jobs brought her to the attention of David Ben-Gurion, and her political career took off. Fund-raising in America in 1948, secretly meeting in Amman with King Abdullah right before Israel's declaration of independence, mobbed by thousands of Jews in a Moscow synagogue in 1948 as Israel's first representative to the USSR, serving as minister of labor and foreign minister in the 1950s and 1960s, Golda brought fiery oratory, plainspoken appeals, and shrewd deal-making to the cause to which she had dedicated her life-the welfare and security of the State of Israel and its inhabitants.  As prime minister, Golda negotiated arms agreements with Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger and had dozens of clandestine meetings with Jordan's King Hussein in the unsuccessful pursuit of a land-for-peace agreement with Israel's neighbors. But her time in office ended in tragedy, when Israel was caught off guard by Egypt and Syria's surprise attack on Yom Kippur in 1973. Analyzing newly available documents from Israeli government archives, Francine Klagsbrun looks into whether Golda could have prevented that war and whether in its darkest days she contemplated using nuclear force. Resigning in the war's aftermath, she spent her final years keeping a hand in national affairs and bemusedly enjoying international acclaim. Klagsbrun's superbly researched and masterly recounted story of Israel's founding mother gives us a Golda for the ages.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|10/17/2017|2017-10-17|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780805243505?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BrfnDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Angela Merkel has always been an outsider. A pastor's daughter raised in Soviet-controlled East Germany, she spent her twenties working as a research chemist, only entering politics after the fall of the Berlin Wall. And yet within fifteen years, she had become chancellor of Germany and, before long, the unofficial leader of the West. Acclaimed author Kati Marton sets out to pierce the mystery of this unlikely ascent. With unparalleled access to the chancellor's inner circle and a trove of records only recently come to light, she teases out the unique political genius that is the secret to Merkel's success. No other modern leader has so ably confronted authoritarian aggression, enacted daring social policies and calmly unified an entire continent in an era when countries are becoming only more divided. Again and again, she's cleverly outmanoeuvred strongmen like Putin and Trump, and weathered surprisingly complicated relationships with allies like Obama and Macron. Famously private, the woman who emerges from these pages is a role model for anyone interested in gaining and keeping power while staying true to one's moral convictions. At once a riveting political biography, an intimate human portrait and a revelatory look at successful leadership in action, The Chancellor brings forth from the shadows one of the most extraordinary women of our time.||1 online resource||943.0883092|ebook - ebook|10/26/2021|2021-10-26|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008499471?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hJIpEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

I want to function rather as a mystagogue, conducting you ever deeper into the mystery of the incarnation in the hopes that you might be transformed by its power. -Father Robert Barron What is Catholicism? A 2,000-year-old living tradition? A worldview? A way of life? A relationship? A mystery? In Catholicism Father Robert Barron examines all these questions and more, seeking to capture the body, heart and mind of the Catholic faith.Starting from the essential foundation of Jesus Christ's incarnation, life, and teaching, Father Barron moves through the defining elements of Catholicism-from sacraments, worship, and prayer, to Mary, the Apostles, and Saints, to grace, salvation, heaven, and hell-using his distinct and dynamic grasp of art, literature, architecture, personal stories, Scripture, theology, philosophy, and history to present the Church to the world. Paired with his documentary film series of the same title, Catholicism is an intimate journey, capturing The Catholic Thing in all its depth and beauty. Eclectic, unique, and inspiring, Father Barron brings the faith to life for a new generation, in a style that is both faithful to timeless truths, while simultaneously speaking in the language of contemporary life.||1 online resource||230.2|ebook - ebook|09/06/2011|2011-09-06|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780307720535?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vtumrY4lYiAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

A triumph'  JACKIE KAY  'Absorbing and poetic'   ECONOMIST     'Full of tenderness and beauty'  MARIANA ENRIQUEZ        From one of Mexico's greatest contemporary writers, an   astonishing work of non-fiction that illuminates   an epidemic of femicide in Mexico through the   death of one woman.      I seek justice, I finally said. I seek justice for my sister . . . Sometimes it takes twenty-nine years to say it out loud, to say it out loud on a phone call with a lawyer at the General Attorney's office: I seek justice.  On the dawn of 16 July 1990, Liliana Rivera Garza, Cristina Rivera Garza's sister, was murdered by her ex-boyfriend and subsumed into Mexico's dark and relentless history of femicide. She was a twenty-year-old architecture student who had been trying for years to end her relationship with a high school boyfriend who insisted on not letting her go. A few weeks before the tragedy, Liliana made a definitive decision: at the height of her winter she had discovered that, as Albert Camus had said, there was an invincible summer in her. She would leave him behind. She would start a new life. She would do a master's degree and a doctorate; she would travel to London. But his decision was that she would not have a life without him. Returning to Mexico after decades of living in the United States, Cristina Rivera Garza collects and curates evidence – handwritten letters, police reports, school notebooks, voice recordings and architectural blueprints – to defy a pattern of increasingly normalised, gendered violence and understand the life lost. What she finds is Liliana: her sister's voice crossing time and, like that of so many disappeared and outraged women in Mexico, demanding justice.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|03/16/2023|2023-03-16|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781526649386?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=s0qOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

James Legge.|The I Ching|Legge, James|Legge, James||Nonfiction., Taoism, Divination, Confucianism, Philosophy, Chinese, Philosophy, Philosophy., Electronic books., Electronic book|Philosophy|One of the most important books in the history of Oriental culture is the I Ching, or as it is usually called in English, the Book of Changes. Its basic text seems to have been prepared before 1,000 B.C., in the last days of the Shang Dynasty and the first part of the Chou Dynasty. It was one of the Five Classics edited by Confucius, who is reported to have wished he had fifty more years of life to study it. Since the time of Confucius it has never lost its enormous significance; it has been used by Confucianists and Taoists alike, by learned literary scholars and street shamans, by the official state cult and by private individuals.Basically, the I Ching is a manual of divination, founded upon what modern scholars like Wolfgang Pauli, the Nobel Laureate physicist and C. G. Jung, the psychoanalyst, have called the synchronistic concept of the universe. This means that all things happening at a certain time have certain characteristic features which can be isolated, so that in addition to vertical causality, one may also have horizontal linkages. According to tradition, King Wan and his son the Duke of Chou spent their lives analyzing the results of divination in terms of interacting polar forces and six-variable hexagrams, correlating an observed body of events with predictions. Whether this account is true or not, the I Ching still retains its primacy in Chinese thought.Apart from its enormous value in Oriental studies, the I Ching is very important in the history of religions, history of philosophy, and even in certain aspects of modern Western thought. It is one of the very few divination manuals that have survived into modern times, and it is typologically interesting as perhaps the most developed, most elaborate system that is known in detail. In philosophy, it marks a stage in the development of human thought, while the I Ching has recently become very important in the understanding of certain cultural developments in the Western world.This present work is the standard English translation by the great Sinologist James Legge, prepared for the Sacred Books of the East series. It contains the basic text attributed to King Wan and the Duke of Chou, the ten appendices usually attributed to Confucius, a profound introduction by Legge, and exhaustive footnotes explaining the text for a Western reader.||1 online resource||299|ebook - ebook|09/19/2013|2012-07-12|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780486147611?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Uv_BAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The cost of saving a life, creating a life or compensating for a life taken is routinely calculated and put into practice. In a world in love with data, it is possible to run a cost-benefit analysis on anything - including life itself. For philanthropists, judges, criminals, healthcare providers and government ministers, it's just part of the job. In a series of extraordinary encounters - with people who have faked their own death or lost a loved one to terrorism, with hitmen and with modern day slaves - Kleeman discovers more questions than answers. What does it mean for our humanity when we crunch the numbers to decide who gets the expensive life-saving drugs, and who misses out? What do we learn about ourselves when philanthropic giving by the effective altruists in Silicon Valley is received by some, while others are left to suffer? Are some lives really worth more than others? And what happens when we take human emotions out of the equation? Does it make for a fairer decision-making process - or for moral bankruptcy? Exploring the final frontier in monetization, Kleeman asks what we lose and what we gain by leaving the judgments that really matter up to cold, hard logic. _____  'Compelling'   - Literary Review   'Reframes how you think about the world'  - Sophie Elmhirst, author of  Maurice and Maralyn   'Gripping' -   Daily Mail   'Writing, thinking and storytelling at its best'  - Ben Judah, author of  This Is Europe||1 online resource||179.7|ebook - ebook|03/14/2024|2024-03-14|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781035004997?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UWbGEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

A profound and original book, the work of a gifted thinker.-Daphne Merkin, The Wall Street Journal   Attempting to break the agonizing impasse between Israelis and Palestinians, the Israeli commentator and award-winning author of Like Dreamers directly addresses his Palestinian neighbors in this taut and provocative book, empathizing with Palestinian suffering and longing for reconciliation as he explores how the conflict looks through Israeli eyes.  I call you neighbor because I don't know your name, or anything personal about you. Given our circumstances, neighbor might be too casual a word to describe our relationship. We are intruders into each other's dream, violators of each other's sense of home. We are incarnations of each other's worst historical nightmares. Neighbors?  Letters to My Palestinian Neighbor is one Israeli's powerful attempt to reach beyond the wall that separates Israelis and Palestinians and into the hearts of the enemy. In a series of letters, Yossi Klein Halevi explains what motivated him to leave his native New York in his twenties and move to Israel to participate in the drama of the renewal of a Jewish homeland, which he is committed to see succeed as a morally responsible, democratic state in the Middle East.  This is the first attempt by an Israeli author to directly address his Palestinian neighbors and describe how the conflict appears through Israeli eyes. Halevi untangles the ideological and emotional knot that has defined the conflict for nearly a century. In lyrical, evocative language, he unravels the complex strands of faith, pride, anger and anguish he feels as a Jew living in Israel, using history and personal experience as his guide.  Halevi's letters speak not only to his Palestinian neighbor, but to all concerned global citizens, helping us understand the painful choices confronting Israelis and Palestinians that will ultimately help determine the fate of the region.||1 online resource||956.94054|ebook - ebook|06/18/2019|2019-06-18|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062968661?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7z2aDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Ben Hubbard.|MBS: The Rise to Power of Mohammed Bin Salman|Hubbard, Ben|Hubbard, Ben.|Ben Hubbard|Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., Electronic books.|Biography & Autobiography|The gripping, untold story of how Saudi Arabia's secretive and mercurial new ruler rose to power. Even in his youth as a prince among thousands of princes, Mohammed bin Salman nurtured sweeping ambitions. He wanted power - enough of it to reshape his hyper-conservative, insular Islamic kingdom. When his elderly father took the throne in 2015, MBS got his chance. As the hands-on-ruler, he made seismic changes, working doggedly to overhaul the kingdom's economy, loosen its strict Islamic social codes and confront nearby enemies, especially Iran. His vision initially won fans at home and abroad as he convinced other nations that the moment had come to bet big on Saudi Arabia. Over time, however, the sheen of the visionary young reformer has tarnished, leaving many wondering whether MBS is actually an aspiring dictator whose lack of experience and rash decisions are destabilizing the world's most volatile region. Based on years of reporting and hundreds of covert interviews, MBS provides new insights into Saudi Arabia's catastrophic military intervention in Yemen, the bizarre detention of the Lebanese prime minister, the surprise arrest of hundreds of princes and businessmen, and the greatest scandal of the young prince's rise: the brutal murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi state officials with links to MBS - a crime that shocked the world. A riveting portrait of a determined autocrat on the rise, MBS asks how one man's actions and obsessions are shaking the Middle East.||1 online resource||953.805092|ebook - ebook|03/10/2020|2020-03-10|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008340575?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CHzLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Despite intense opposition, Winston Churchill personally gave Stirling permission to recruit the toughest, brightest and most ruthless soldiers he could find. So began the most celebrated and mysterious military organisation in the world: the SAS. Now, 75 years later, the SAS has finally decided to tell its astonishing story. It has opened its secret archives for the first time, granting historian Ben Macintyre full access to a treasure trove of unseen reports, memos, diaries, letters, maps and photographs, as well as free rein to interview surviving Originals and those who knew them. The result is an exhilarating tale of fearlessness and heroism, recklessness and tragedy; of extraordinary men who were willing to take monumental risks.

This doctrine, argues Avi Shlaim, became central to Israeli policy; dissenters were marginalized and many opportunities to reconcile with Palestinian Arabs were lost. Drawing on a great deal of new material and interviews with many key participants, Shlaim places Israel's political and military actions under and uncompromising lens. His analysis will bring scant comfort to partisans on both sides, but it will be required reading for anyone interested in this fascinating and troubled region of the world.

Scott|Nonfiction., Peasants Political activity Southeast Asia., Ethnology Southeast Asia., Science., Southeast Asia Politics and government 1945-, Southeast Asia Rural conditions., Electronic books.|Social Science|For two thousand years the disparate groups that now reside in Zomia (a mountainous region the size of Europe that consists of portions of seven Asian countries) have fled the projects of the organized state societies that surround them-slavery, conscription, taxes, corvée labor, epidemics, and warfare. This book, essentially an anarchist history, is the first-ever examination of the huge literature on state-making whose author evaluates why people would deliberately and reactively remain stateless. Among the strategies employed by the people of Zomia to remain stateless are physical dispersion in rugged terrain; agricultural practices that enhance mobility; pliable ethnic identities; devotion to prophetic, millenarian leaders; and maintenance of a largely oral culture that allows them to reinvent their histories and genealogies as they move between and around states. In accessible language, James Scott, recognized worldwide as an eminent authority in Southeast Asian, peasant, and agrarian studies, tells the story of the peoples of Zomia and their unlikely odyssey in search of self-determination. He redefines our views on Asian politics, history, demographics, and even our fundamental ideas about what constitutes civilization, and challenges us with a radically different approach to history that presents events from the perspective of stateless peoples and redefines state-making as a form of internal colonialism. This new perspective requires a radical reevaluation of the civilizational narratives of the lowland states. Scott's work on Zomia represents a new way to think of area studies that will be applicable to other runaway, fugitive, and marooned communities, be they Gypsies, Cossacks, tribes fleeing slave raiders, Marsh Arabs, or San-Bushmen.||1 online resource||959|ebook - ebook|12/16/2009|2009-01-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780300156522?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oiLYu2-uc8IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Now however, with Russia rattling its sabre on the borders of Europe and China rising to challenge the post-1945 world order, the liberal West faces major threats. These threats are not only external. Especially in the Anglosphere, the 'decolonisation' movement corrodes the West's self-confidence by retelling the history of European and American colonial dominance as a litany of racism, exploitation, and massively murderous violence. Nigel Biggar tests this indictment, addressing the crucial questions in eight chapters: Was the British Empire driven primarily by greed and the lust to dominate? Should we speak of 'colonialism and slavery' in the same breath, as if they were identical? Was the Empire essentially racist? How far was it based on the theft of land? Did it involve genocide? Was it driven fundamentally by the motive of economic exploitation? Was undemocratic colonial government necessarily illegitimate? and, Was the Empire essentially violent, and its violence pervasively racist and terroristic? Biggar makes clear that, like any other long-standing state, the British Empire involved elements of injustice, sometimes appalling. On occasions it was culpably incompetent and presided over moments of dreadful tragedy. Nevertheless, from the early 1800s the Empire was committed to abolishing the slave trade in the name of a Christian conviction of the basic equality of all human beings. It ended endemic inter-tribal warfare, opened local economies to the opportunities of global trade, moderated the impact of inescapable modernisation, established the rule of law and liberal institutions such as a free press, and spent itself in defeating the murderously racist Nazi and Japanese empires in the Second World War. As encyclopaedic in historical breadth as it is penetrating in analytical depth, Colonialism offers a moral inquest into the colonial past, forensically contesting damaging falsehoods and thereby helping to rejuvenate faith in the West's future.||1 online resource||325.341|ebook - ebook|02/02/2023|2023-02-02|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008511654?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XopbEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Goodman|Nonfiction., Wealth Moral and ethical aspects., Democracy., Capitalism Moral and ethical aspects., Billionaires., Democracy., Wealth Moral and ethical aspects., Capitalism Moral and ethical aspects., Billionaires., Business., Politics., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|From the New York Times's Global Economics Correspondent, a masterwork of explanatory journalism that exposes how billionaires' systematic plunder of the world-brazenly accelerated during the pandemic-has transformed 21st-century life and dangerously destabilized democracy.     Davos Man will be read a hundred years from now as a warning. ... Deliciously rich with searing detail, the clarity is reminiscent of Tom Wolfe. -EVAN OSNOS   The history of the last half century in America, Europe, and other major economies is in large part the story of wealth flowing upward. The most affluent people emerged from capitalism's triumph in the Cold War to loot the peace, depriving governments of the resources needed to serve their people, and leaving them tragically unprepared for the worst pandemic in a century.  Drawing on decades of experience covering the global economy, award-winning journalist Peter S. Goodman profiles five representative Davos Men-members of the billionaire class-chronicling how their shocking exploitation of the global pandemic has hastened a fifty-year trend of wealth centralization. Alongside this reporting, Goodman delivers textured portraits of those caught in Davos Man's wake, including a former steelworker in the American Midwest, a Bangladeshi migrant in Qatar, a Seattle doctor on the front lines of the fight against COVID, blue-collar workers in the tenements of Buenos Aires, an African immigrant in Sweden, a textile manufacturer in Italy, an Amazon warehouse employee in New York City, and more.  Goodman's rollicking and revelatory exposé of the global billionaire class reveals their hidden impact on nearly every aspect of modern society: widening wealth inequality, the rise of anti-democratic nationalism, the shrinking opportunity to earn a livable wage, the vulnerabilities of our health-care systems, access to affordable housing, unequal taxation, and even the quality of the shirt on your back. Meticulously reported yet compulsively readable, Davos Man is an essential read for anyone concerned about economic justice, the capacity of societies to grapple with their greatest challenges, and the sanctity of representative government.||1 online resource||305.5234|ebook - ebook|01/18/2022|2022-01-18|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780063078321?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nlIqEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Operation Mincemeat was the most successful wartime deception ever attempted, and certainly the strangest. It hoodwinked the Nazi espionage chiefs, sent German troops hurtling in the wrong direction, and saved thousands of lives by deploying a secret agent who was different, in one crucial respect, from any spy before or since: he was dead. His mission: to convince the Germans that instead of attacking Sicily, the Allied armies planned to invade Greece. The brainchild of an eccentric RAF officer and a brilliant Jewish barrister, the great hoax involved an extraordinary cast of characters including a famous forensic pathologist, a gold-prospector, an inventor, a beautiful secret service secretary, a submarine captain, three novelists, a transvestite English...|Title from eBook information screen.|||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|01/18/2010|2010-01-18|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781408808542?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q6JAazB9nCwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Jonathan Tepperman.|The Fix|Tepperman, Jonathan|Tepperman, Jonathan.|Jonathan Tepperman|Nonfiction., Business., Politics., Electronic books., Electronic book|Political Science|A provocative look at the world's most difficult, seemingly ineradicable problems—and the surprising stories of the countries that solved them.   We all know the bad news. The heady promise of the Arab Spring has given way to repression, civil war, and an epic refugee crisis. Economic growth is sputtering. Income inequality is rising around the world. And the threat of ISIS and other extremist groups keeps spreading. We are living in an age of unprecedented, irreversible decline—or so we're constantly being told. Jonathan Tepperman's The Fix presents a very different picture. The book reveals the often-overlooked success stories, offering a provocative, unconventional take on the answers hiding in plain sight. It identifies ten pervasive and seemingly impossible challenges—including immigration reform, economic stagnation, political gridlock, corruption, and Islamist extremism—and shows that, contrary to the general consensus, each has a solution, and not merely a hypothetical one. In his close analysis of government initiatives as diverse as Brazil's Bolsa Família program, Indonesia's campaign against radicalism, Canada's early embrace of multiculturalism, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg's efforts to prevent another 9/11, Tepperman captures the moments in time which reveal the broadly applicable measures which can boost and buttress equality, incomes, cooperation, and cohesion in wildly diverse societies. He flips conventional political wisdom on its head, showing, for example, how much the U.S. Congress could learn about compromise and conciliation from its counterpart in Mexico. Tepperman has traveled the world to write this book, conducting more than a hundred interviews with the people behind the policies. Meticulously researched and deeply reported, The Fix presents practical advice for problem-solvers of all stripes, and stands as a necessary corrective to the hand-wringing and grim prognostication that dominates the news, making a data-driven case for optimism in a time of crushing pessimism.From the Hardcover edition.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|09/20/2016|2016-09-20|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781101902998?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DWexCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

That story-and the story of what happened afterwards-has been told many times, but always following the narrative offered by the Spaniards. After all, we have been taught, it was the Europeans who held the pens. But the Native Americans were intrigued by the Roman alphabet and, unbeknownst to the newcomers, they used it to write detailed histories in their own language of Nahuatl. Until recently, these sources remained obscure, only partially translated, and rarely consulted by scholars. For the first time, in  Fifth Sun , the history of the Aztecs is offered in all its complexity based solely on the texts written by the indigenous people themselves. Camilla Townsend presents an accessible and humanized depiction of these native Mexicans, rather than seeing them as the exotic, bloody figures of European stereotypes. The conquest, in this work, is neither an apocalyptic moment, nor an origin story launching Mexicans into existence. The Mexica people had a history of their own long before the Europeans arrived and did not simply capitulate to Spanish culture and colonization. Instead, they realigned their political allegiances, accommodated new obligations, adopted new technologies, and endured. This engaging revisionist history of the Aztecs, told through their own words, explores the experience of a once-powerful people facing the trauma of conquest and finding ways to survive, offering an empathetic interpretation for experts and non-specialists alike.|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||972|ebook - ebook|10/04/2019|2019-10-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780190673086?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=h5OzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Michael Sheridan.|The Gate to China: A New History of the People’s Republic & Hong Kong|Sheridan, Michael|Sheridan, Michael.|Michael Sheridan|Nonfiction., History., Electronic books.|History|'A delightful piece of writing and research which describes the remarkable history behind the handover of this unique and exciting city' Jasper Becker 'Deeply researched and beautifully written' Mike Chinoy A superb new history of the rise of China and the fall of Hong Kong to authoritarian rule. The rise of China and the fall of Hong Kong to authoritarian rule are told with unique insight in this new history by Michael Sheridan, drawing on eyewitness reporting over three decades, interviews with key figures and documents from archives in China and the West. The story sweeps the reader from the earliest days of trade through the Opium Wars of the 19th century to the age of globalisation and the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China. It ends with the battle for democracy on the city's streets and the ultimate victory of the Chinese Communist Party. How did it come to this? We learn from private papers that Margaret Thatcher anguished over the fate of Hong Kong, sought secret American briefings on how to handle China and put her trust in an adviser who was torn between duty and pride. The deal they made with Beijing did not last. The Chinese side of this history, so often unheard, emerges from memoirs and documents, many new to the foreign reader, revealing how the party's iron will and negotiating tactics crushed its opponents. Yet the voices of Hong Kong people - eloquent, smart and bold - speak out here for ideals that refuse to die. Sheridan's book tells how Hong Kong opened the way for the People's Republic as it reformed its economy and changed the world, emerging to challenge the West with a new order that raises fundamental questions about progress, identity and freedom. It is critical reading for all who study, trade or deal with China.||1 online resource||330.090|ebook - ebook|09/16/2021|2021-09-16|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008356248?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z7wgEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Congo was at last being set free from Belgium-one of seventeen countries to gain independence in 1960 from ruling European powers. At the helm as prime minister was charismatic nationalist  Patrice Lumumba. Just days after the handover, however, the Congo's new army mutinied, Belgian forces intervened, and Lumumba turned to the United Nations for help in saving his newborn nation from what the press was already calling the Congo crisis. Dag Hammarskjöld, the tidy Swede serving as UN secretary-general, quickly arranged the organization's biggest peacekeeping mission in history. But chaos was still spreading. Frustrated with the fecklessness of the UN and spurned by the United States, Lumumba then approached the Soviets for help-an appeal that set off alarm bells at the CIA. To forestall the spread of Communism in Africa, the CIA sent word to its station chief in the Congo, Larry Devlin: Lumumba had to go. Within a year, everything would unravel. The CIA plot to murder Lumumba would ﬁzzle out, but he would be deposed in a CIA-backed coup, transferred to enemy territory in a CIA-approved operation, and shot dead by Congolese assassins. Hammarskjöld, too, would die, in a mysterious plane crash en route to negotiate a cease-ﬁre with the Congo's rebellious southeast. And a young, ambitious military officer named Joseph Mobutu, who had once sworn fealty to Lumumba, would seize power with U.S. help and misrule the country for more than three decades. For the Congolese people, the events of 1960-61 represented the opening chapter of a long horror story.

His political career was marked mostly by setbacks, yet he became a cult figure in China after his death. Today he is the only 20th-century Chinese leader to be widely revered on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. In contrast, many Western historians see little in his ideas or deeds to warrant such high esteem. This book presents the most balanced account of Sun to date, one that situates him within the historical events and intellectual climate of his time. Born in the shadow of the Opium War, the young Sun saw China repeatedly humiliated in clashes with foreign powers, resulting in the loss of territory and sovereignty. When his efforts to petition the decrepit Manchu court to institute reforms failed, Sun took to revolution. Sun traversed the globe to canvass support for his cause. A notable feature of the book is its coverage of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and their contributions to his uprisings on the mainland, which set the stage for the overthrow of two millennia of imperial rule in 1911. But Sun's vision of China was not to be. Within a few years the republic was hijacked and plunged into chaos. This fascinating and immensely readable work illuminates the man and his achievements, his strengths and his weaknesses, revealing how he came to spearhead the revolution that would transform his country and yet, at his death in 1925 and still today, remain agonizingly unfinished. I've read at least 30 or 40 biographies of Sun Yat Sen in my life, so I was intrigued to find out what Kayloe had to say that's new. I was fascinated. He really tells the story afresh. Through a lively series of chapters that capture different phases of Sun's life and career, Kayloe tries to understand and to convey to us what made this remarkable man tick. A very readable book... I strongly recommend it. - Prof Wang Gungwu, Founding Chairman, Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, and University Professor, National University of Singapore||1 online resource||951.041092|ebook - ebook|01/11/2018|2017-09-15|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9789814779678?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RuBBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In the 19th, Napoleon's defeat gave birth to the world of rivalrous European powers. In the 20th, the First World War triggered a wave of revolutions that cleared a path for the American era. Ours appears to be no different.The world is once again on the move: China extends its influence across the globe; Europe is struggling to maintain unity and the United States looks hollowed out by its own past adventures. Meanwhile Russia is up to a lot of startlingly bold new tricks.In this expanded new edition of The World in Conflict, John Andrews tackles head-on the reasons why global violence is ever-present in our lives. He analyses every single one of today's major conflicts region by region, considering the causes, contexts, participants, impacts and likely outcomes. He looks at recently-ended wars that still spawn intermittent fighting. And he considers where, why and how new conflicts might erupt.  This is a must-read for our interesting times, a guide to our new world of terrorism, kompromat and cyber war, shifting powers and enduring strife. If you want to know who is fighting where, for what, and whether they can win, The World in Conflict is indispensable.||1 online resource||327.16|ebook - ebook|01/14/2016|2016-01-14|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781782831150?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=00GkCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

July 24, 1911, was a day for the history books. For on that rainy morning, the young Yale professor Hiram Bingham III climbed into the Andes Mountains of Peru and encountered an ancient city in the clouds: the now famous citadel of Machu Picchu. Nearly a century later, news reports have recast the hero explorer as a villain who smuggled out priceless artifacts and stole credit for finding one of the world's greatest archaeological sites.  Mark Adams has spent his career editing adventure and travel magazines, so his plan to investigate the allegations against Bingham by retracing the explorer's perilous path to Machu Picchu isn't completely far- fetched, even if it does require him to sleep in a tent for the first time. With a crusty, antisocial Australian survivalist and several Quechua-speaking, coca-chewing mule tenders as his guides, Adams takes readers through some of the most gorgeous and historic landscapes in Peru, from the ancient Inca capital of Cusco to the enigmatic ruins of Vitcos and Vilcabamba.  Along the way he finds a still-undiscovered country populated with brilliant and eccentric characters, as well as an answer to the question that has nagged scientists since Hiram Bingham's time: Just what was Machu Picchu?Watch a Video||1 online resource||985.37|ebook - ebook|06/30/2011|2011-06-30|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781101535400?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xp9UL1N-fCIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

And yet, a decade ago, the same bank was hit with a record US fine of $1.9 billion for facilitating money laundering for 'drug kingpins and rogue nations'. In pursuit of their goal of becoming the biggest bank in the world, between 2003 to 2010, HSBC allowed El Chapo and the Sinaloa cartel, one of the most notorious and murderous criminal organizations in the world, to turn its ill-gotten money into clean dollars and thereby grow one of the deadliest drugs empires the world has ever seen. How did a bank, which boasts 'we're committed to helping protect the world's financial system on which millions of people depend, by only doing business with customers who meet our high standards of transparency' come to facilitate Mexico's richest drug baron? And how did a bank that had been named 'one of the best-run organizations in the world' become so entwined with one of the most barbaric groups of gangsters on the planet?  Too Big to Jail  is an extraordinary story brilliantly told by writer, commentator, and former editor of  The Independent , Chris Blackhurst, that starts in Hong Kong and ranges across London, Washington, the Cayman Islands and Mexico, where HSBC saw the opportunity to become the largest bank in the world, and El Chapo seized the chance to fuel his murderous empire by laundering his drug proceeds through the bank. It brings together an extraordinary cast of politicians, bankers, drug dealers, FBI officers and whistle-blowers, and asks what price does greed have? Whose job is it to police global finance? And why did not a single person go to prison for facilitating the murderous expansion of a global drug empire?|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|06/09/2022|2022-06-09|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781529065053?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RG5YEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It's both a cause for hope, and a call to arms.-Jane Mayer, author  Dark Money  From historian and author of the popular daily newsletter LETTERS FROM AN AMERICAN, a vital narrative that explains how America, once  a beacon of democracy, now teeters on the brink of autocracy - and how we can turn back.  In the midst of the impeachment crisis of 2019, Heather Cox Richardson launched a daily Facebook essay providing the historical background of the daily torrent of news. It soon turned into a newsletter and its readership ballooned to more than 2 million dedicated readers who rely on her plainspoken and informed take on the present and past in America.  In  Democracy Awakening , Richardson crafts a compelling and original narrative, explaining how, over the decades, a small group of wealthy people have made war on American ideals. By weaponizing language and promoting false history they have led us into authoritarianism - creating a disaffected population and then promising to recreate an imagined past where those people could feel important again. She argues that taking our country back starts by remembering the elements of the nation's true history that marginalized Americans have always upheld. Their dedication to the principles on which this nation was founded has enabled us to renew and expand our commitment to democracy in the past. Richardson sees this history as a roadmap for the nation's future. Richardson's talent is to wrangle our giant, meandering, and confusing news feed into a coherent story that singles out what we should pay attention to, what the precedents are, and what possible paths lie ahead. In her trademark calm prose, she is realistic and optimistic about the future of democracy. Her command of history allows her to pivot effortlessly from the Founders to the abolitionists to Reconstruction to Goldwater to Mitch McConnell, highlighting the political legacies of the New Deal, the lingering fears of socialism, the death of the liberal consensus and birth of movement conservatism.   Many books tell us what has happened over the last five years.  Democracy Awakening  explains how we got to this perilous point, what our history really tells us about ourselves, and what the future of democracy can be.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|09/26/2023|2023-09-26|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593652978?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eX6pEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Beginning with the very first efforts by the British government to 'open' China to trade, Stephen Platt tells the epic story of the decades leading up to the war and, given the growing uncertainty in current relations between China and the West, shows how the conflict still has important implications for the world today.|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|06/07/2018|2018-06-07|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781786494887?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vUdODwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Tom Baldwin.|Keir Starmer: The Biography|Baldwin, Tom|Baldwin, Tom.|Tom Baldwin|Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., History., Politics., Electronic books.|Biography & Autobiography|'The first serious and consistently readable biography of Starmer...It is a wonder that he has said so much to Baldwin' PATRICK MAGUIRE, THE TIMES 'This will be the most important political book of the year' MATTHEW D'ANCONA, EVENING STANDARD This authoritative – but not authorised – biography by Tom Baldwin provides answers by drawing deeply on many hours of interviews with the Labour leader himself, as well as unprecedented access to members of his family, his oldest friends and closest colleagues. Together, they tell an unexpectedly intimate story filled with feelings of grief and love that has driven him on more than any rigid ideology or loyalty to a particular faction. The book tracks Starmer's emergence from a troubled small town background and rebellious youth, through a storied legal career as a human rights barrister and the country's chief prosecutor, to becoming an MP relatively late in life. Baldwin provides a vivid and compelling account of how this untypical politician then rose to be leader of his party in succession to Jeremy Corbyn, then transformed it with a ruthless rapidity that has enraged opponents from the left just as much as it has bewildered those on the right. Above all, this is a book that should be read by anyone who wants to understand how someone who has too often been underestimated or dismissed as dull, now intends to change Britain. 'Highly readable... Baldwin has peeled back more layers than anyone else' ROBERT SHRIMSLEY, FINANCIAL TIMES 'Tom Baldwin's portrait is off a tough, conscientious, and kindly man with the right values' ANDREW MARR, NEW STATESMAN 'Rigorously researched, lucidly written and highly engaging' FINTAN O'TOOLE, TLS 'Baldwin achieves his purpose of making Starmer seem more likable and less boring' LYNN BARBER, SPECTATOR 'A highly informative, illuminating and insightful biography... the most complete portrait we have yet been offered' OBSERVER||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|02/29/2024|2024-02-29|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008661038?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_bnXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Alex Joske.|Spies and Lies|Joske, Alex|Joske, Alex.|Alex Joske|Nonfiction., Politics., Electronic books.|Political Science|Spies and Lies  by Alex Joske is a groundbreaking exposé of elite influence operations by China's little-known Ministry of State Security. Revealing for the first time how the Chinese Communist Party has tasked its spies to deceive the world, it challenges the conventional account of China's past, present and future.  Mere years ago, Western governments chose to cooperate with China in the hope that it would liberalise, setting aside concerns about human rights abuses, totalitarian ambitions and espionage. But the axiom of China's 'peaceful rise' has been fundamentally challenged by the Chinese Communist Party's authoritarian behaviour under Xi Jinping.  How did we get it wrong for so long?  Spies and Lies  pierces the Ministry of State Security's walls of secrecy and reveals how agents of the Chinese Communist Party have spent decades manipulating the West's attitudes - from an Australian prime minister to the US Congress, prominent think tanks and the FBI - about China's rise. Through interviews with defectors and intelligence officers, classified Chinese intelligence documents and original investigations, the book unmasks dozens of active Chinese intelligence officers along with global MSS fronts, including travel agencies, writers associations, publishing houses, alumni associations, newspapers, a Buddhist temple, a record company and charities.  Spies and Lies  is an extraordinary insight into the most successful influence operation in history - one which has fooled the West for years - and is indispensable reading.||1 online resource||327.1251009|ebook - ebook|10/05/2022|2022-10-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781743589007?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1sp8EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

New Testament Criticism, interpretation, etc., Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., Religion & Spirituality., Electronic books.|Religion|Mary appears only a few times in the Bible, but those few passages come at crucial moments. Catholics believe that Mary is the ever-virgin Mother of God, the Queen of Heaven and Earth. But she also was a human being--a woman who made a journey of faith through various trials and uncertainties and endured her share of suffering. Even with her unique graces and vocation, Mary remains a woman we can relate to and from whom we have much to learn.In Walking with Mary, Edward Sri looks at the crucial passages in the Bible concerning Mary and offers insight about the Blessed Mother's faith and devotion that we can apply in our daily lives. We follow her step-by-step through the New Testament account of her life, reflecting on what the Scriptures tell us about how she responded to the dramatic events unfolding around her.This book is the fruit of my personal journey of studying Mary through the Scriptures, from her initial calling in Nazareth to her painful experience at the cross, writes Edward Sri It is intended to be a highly readable, accessible work that draws on wisdom from the Catholic tradition, recent popes, and biblical scholars of a variety of perspectives and traditions. With the riches of these insights, we will ponder what her journey of faith may have been like in order to draw out spiritual lessons for our own walk with God. He add, It is my hope, therefore, that whether you are of a Catholic, Protestant, or other faith background, this book may help you to know, understand, and love Mary more, and that it may inspire you to walk in her footsteps as a faithful disciple of the Lord in your own pilgrimage of faith.||1 online resource||232.91|ebook - ebook|09/10/2013|2013-09-10|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780385348041?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OZ1tZVSsFykC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

This step forward provides a clear guide to action: first, in the decisive stage of completing a moderately prosperous society in all respects, second, on a new journey to fully build a modern socialist China, and third, in realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation. Xi Jinping is the principal proponent of this Thought. Xi Jinping: The Governance of China was published in September 2014. It has been distributed in China and abroad in Chinese, English, French, Russian, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Japanese, and many other languages. The book attracted widespread attention, and was highly acclaimed by readers. It has played a significant role in helping officials and the general public to study and understand Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. It is an important work that helps the international community to better understand China and the CPC. After the 19th CPC National Congress, a second volume of Xi Jinping: The Governance of China was published in November 2017, to help Chinese and foreign readers gain a systematic appreciation of the depth and innovative qualities of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The two volumes are an integrated whole when studying Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. They present the developments and major contents of the Thought; record how the CPC Central Committee, with Xi Jinping as the core, has united and led the whole Party and the whole nation in developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era; and embody the Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions that the CPC has contributed to building a community of shared future for mankind and promoting peace and development. They will be an authoritative source through which readers can learn about Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and about the guiding principles of the 19th CPC National Congress.

A Fever in the Heartland  is compelling, powerful, and profoundly resonant today. - David Grann, author of THE WAGER and KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON A historical thriller by the Pulitzer and National Book Award-winning author that tells the riveting story of the Klan's rise to power in the 1920s, the cunning con man who drove that rise, and the woman who stopped them.  The Roaring Twenties-the Jazz Age-has been characterized as a time of Gatsby frivolity. But it was also the height of the uniquely American hate group, the Ku Klux Klan. Their domain was not the old Confederacy, but the Heartland and the West. They hated Blacks, Jews, Catholics and immigrants in equal measure, and took radical steps to keep these people from the American promise. And the man who set in motion their takeover of great swaths of America was a charismatic charlatan named D.C. Stephenson. Stephenson was a magnetic presence whose life story changed with every telling. Within two years of his arrival in Indiana, he'd become the Grand Dragon of the state and the architect of the strategy that brought the group out of the shadows - their message endorsed from the pulpits of local churches, spread at family picnics and town celebrations. Judges, prosecutors, ministers, governors and senators across the country all proudly proclaimed their membership. But at the peak of his influence, it was a seemingly powerless woman - Madge Oberholtzer - who would reveal his secret cruelties, and whose deathbed testimony finally brought the Klan to their knees. A FEVER IN THE HEARTLAND marries a propulsive drama to a powerful and page-turning reckoning with one of the darkest threads in American history.||1 online resource||322.4209772|ebook - ebook|04/04/2023|2023-04-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780735225275?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0Q15EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

On the eve of this centenary, journalist Johann Hari set off on an epic three-year, 30,000-mile journey into the war on drugs to uncover its secrets-and he found that there is a startling gap between what we have been told and what is really going on. As strange as it may seem at first, drugs are not what we have been told they are; addiction is not what we think it is; and the drug war has very different motives to the ones we have seen on our TV screens.In Chasing the Scream, Hari reveals his startling discoveries entirely through the true and shocking stories of people across the world whose lives have been transformed by this war. They range from a transsexual crack dealer in Brooklyn searching for her mother, to a teenage hit-man in Mexico searching for a way out. It begins with Hari's discovery that at the birth of the drug war, Billie Holiday was stalked and killed by the man who launched this crusade-while it ends with the story of a brave doctor who has led his country to decriminalize every drug, from cannabis to crack, with remarkable results.Chasing the Scream lays bare what we really have been chasing in our century of drug war-in our hunger for drugs, and in our attempt to destroy them. This book will challenge and change how you think about the most controversial-and consequential-question of our time.||1 online resource||363.450973|ebook - ebook|01/15/2015|2015-01-15|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781408857854?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i0cwBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Banks drowning in bad loans. An urban landscape littered with ghost towns of empty property. Industrial zones stalked by zombie firms. Trade tariffs blocking the path to global markets. And yet, against the odds and against expectations, growth continues, wealth rises, international influence expands. The coming collapse of China is always coming, never arriving. Thomas Orlik, a veteran of more than a decade in Beijing, turns the spotlight on China's fragile fundamentals, and resources for resilience. Drawing on discussions with Communist cadres, shadow bankers, and migrant workers, Orlik pieces together a unique perspective on China's past, present, and possible futures. From Deng Xiaoping's reform and opening to Donald Trump's trade war, Orlik traces the policy steps and missteps that have taken China to the brink of a Lehman moment credit crisis. Delving into the balance sheets for banks, corporates, and local governments, he plumbs the depths of financial risks. From Japan in 1989, to Korea in 1997, to the U.S. in 2007, he positions China in the context of a rolling series of global crisis.

Drawing on her background in anthropology and primatology, she tried looking at her new world through that lens, and suddenly things fell into place. She understood the other mothers' snobbiness at school drop-off when she compared them to olive baboons. Her obsessional quest for a Hermes Birkin handbag made sense when she realized other females wielded them to establish dominance in their troop. And so she analyzed tribal migration patterns; display rituals; physical adornment, mutilation, and mating practices; extra-pair copulation; and more. Her conclusions are smart, thought-provoking, and hilariously unexpected. Every city has its Upper East Side, and in Wednesday's memoir, readers everywhere will recognize the strange cultural codes of powerful social hierarchies and the compelling desire to climb them. They will also see that Upper East Side mothers want the same things for their children that all mothers want-safety, happiness, and success-and not even sky-high penthouses and chauffeured SUVs can protect this ecologically released tribe from the universal experiences of anxiety and loss. When Wednesday's life turns upside down, she learns how deep the bonds of female friendship really are. Intelligent, funny, and heartfelt, Primates of Park Avenue lifts a veil on a secret, elite world within a world-the exotic, fascinating, and strangely familiar culture of privileged Manhattan motherhood.||1 online resource||974.710|ebook - ebook|06/02/2015|2015-06-02|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781476762722?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jkYjBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Over the next five years he kept this diary, which describes in detail how Hong Kong was run as a British colony and what happened as the handover approached. The book gives unprecedented insights into negotiating with the Chinese, about how the institutions of democracy in Hong Kong were (belatedly) strengthened and how Patten sought to ensure that a strong degree of self-government would continue after 1997. Unexpectedly, his opponents included not only the Chinese themselves, but some British businessmen and civil service mandarins upset by Patten's efforts, for whom political freedom and the rule of law in Hong Kong seemed less important than keeping on the right side of Beijing. The book concludes with an account of what has happened in Hong Kong since the handover, a powerful assessment of recent events and Patten's reflections on how to deal with China - then and now.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|06/21/2022|2022-06-21|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780141999715?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0xRBEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Michael Cox.||Cox, Michael|Cox, Michael.||F.A. Premier League., Nonfiction., Soccer England History., Sports & Recreations., Electronic books.||An absolutely essential book for every modern football fan, about the development of Premier League tactics, published to coincide with 25 years of the competition. Back in 1992, English football was stuck in the dark ages, emerging from a five-year ban from European competition. The game was physical, bruising and attritional, based on strength over speed, aggression over finesse. It was the era of the midfield general, reducers, big men up front and getting it in the mixer; 4-4-2 was the order of the day. Few teams experimented tactically. And then, almost overnight, it all changed. The creation of the Premier League coincided with one of the most seismic rule changes in football history: the abolition of the back pass. Suddenly defenders had no get out of jail free card, goalkeepers had to be able to field and play the ball and the pace of the game quickened immeasurably. Tactics evolved dramatically, helped by an increased foreign influence. The Mixer is the first book to delve deep into the tactical story of the Premier League, and take a long view of how the game has developed over the last quarter century. From Ferguson's directness to Keegan's relentlessly attacking Newcastle outfit, to Mourinho's cagey, reactive Chelsea, all the way to Ranieri's counter-attacking champions, The Mixer is one of the most entertaining, rich and knowledgeable football books ever written.||1 online resource||796.3340942|ebook - ebook|06/01/2017||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008215569?s=MD|

Ian Johnson.|The Souls of China|Johnson, Ian|Johnson, Ian.|Ian Johnson|Nonfiction., History., Religion & Spirituality., Sociology., China Religion 20th century., China Religion 21st century., Electronic books.|History|From the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, a revelatory portrait of religion in China today-its history, the spiritual traditions of its Eastern and Western faiths, and the ways in which it is influencing China's future. The Souls of China tells the story of one of the world's great spiritual revivals. Following a century of violent anti-religious campaigns, China is now filled with new temples, churches, and mosques-as well as cults, sects, and politicians trying to harness religion for their own ends. Driving this explosion of faith is uncertainty-over what it means to be Chinese and how to live an ethical life in a country that discarded traditional morality a century ago and is searching for new guideposts.Ian Johnson first visited China in 1984; in the 1990s he helped run a charity to rebuild Daoist temples, and in 2001 he won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the suppression of the Falun Gong spiritual movement. While researching this book, he lived for extended periods with underground church members, rural Daoists, and Buddhist pilgrims. Along the way, he learned esoteric meditation techniques, visited a nonagenarian Confucian sage, and befriended government propagandists as they fashioned a remarkable embrace of traditional values. He has distilled these experiences into a cycle of festivals, births, deaths, detentions, and struggle-a great awakening of faith that is shaping the soul of the world's newest superpower.||1 online resource||200.9510905|ebook - ebook|04/11/2017|2017-04-11|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781101870068?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vQ6wDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

More than forty years after it ended, the Vietnam War continues to haunt our country. We still argue over why we were there, whether we could have won, and who was right and wrong in their response to the conflict. When the war divided the country, it created deep political fault lines that continue to divide us today. Now, continuing in the tradition of their critically acclaimed collaborations, the authors draw on dozens and dozens of interviews in America and Vietnam to give us the perspectives of people involved at all levels of the war: US and Vietnamese soldiers and their families, high-level officials in America and Vietnam, antiwar protestors, POWs, and many more. The book plunges us into the chaos and intensity of combat, even as it explains the rationale that got us into Vietnam and kept us there for so many years. Rather than taking sides, the book seeks to understand why the war happened the way it did, and to clarify its complicated legacy. Beautifully written and richly illustrated, this is a tour de force that is certain to launch a new national conversation.||1 online resource||959.7043|ebook - ebook|09/05/2017|2017-09-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781524733100?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i4KyDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Bart D Ehrman.|How Jesus Became God|Ehrman, Bart D.|Ehrman, Bart D.|Bart D. Ehrman|Nonfiction., Historicity of Jesus Christ, Christology, Religion & Spirituality., Electronic books.|Religion|New York Times bestselling author and Bible expert Bart Ehrman reveals how Jesus's divinity became dogma in the first few centuries of the early church.The claim at the heart of the Christian faith is that Jesus of Nazareth was, and is, God. But this is not what the original disciples believed during Jesus's lifetime-and it is not what Jesus claimed about himself. How Jesus Became God tells the story of an idea that shaped Christianity, and of the evolution of a belief that looked very different in the fourth century than it did in the first.A master explainer of Christian history, texts, and traditions, Ehrman reveals how an apocalyptic prophet from the backwaters of rural Galilee crucified for crimes against the state came to be thought of as equal with the one God Almighty, Creator of all things. But how did he move from being a Jewish prophet to being God? In a book that took eight years to research and write, Ehrman sketches Jesus's transformation from a human prophet to the Son of God exalted to divine status at his resurrection. Only when some of Jesus's followers had visions of him after his death-alive again-did anyone come to think that he, the prophet from Galilee, had become God. And what they meant by that was not at all what people mean today.Written for secular historians of religion and believers alike, How Jesus Became God will engage anyone interested in the historical developments that led to the affirmation at the heart of Christianity: Jesus was, and is, God.||1 online resource||232|ebook - ebook|03/25/2014|2014-03-25|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062252197?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dmspAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In 1946, Günther Quandt - patriarch of Germany's most iconic industrial empire, a dynasty that today controls BMW - was arrested for suspected Nazi collaboration. Quandt claimed that he had been forced to join the party by his arch-rival, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, and the courts acquitted him. But Quandt lied. And his heirs, and those of other Nazi billionaires, have only grown wealthier in the generations since, while their reckoning with this dark past remains incomplete at best. Many of them continue to control swaths of the world economy, owning iconic brands whose products blanket the globe. The brutal legacy of the dynasties that dominated Daimler-Benz, cofounded Allianz and still control Porsche, Volkswagen and BMW has remained hidden in plain sight - until now. In this landmark work, investigative journalist David de Jong reveals the true story of how Germany's wealthiest business dynasties amassed untold money and power by abetting the atrocities of the Third Reich. Using a wealth of untapped sources, de Jong shows how these tycoons seized Jewish businesses, procured slave labourers and ramped up weapons production to equip Hitler's army as Europe burnt around them. Most shocking of all, de Jong exposes how the wider world's political expediency enabled these billionaires to get away with their crimes, covering up a bloodstain that defiles the German and global economy to this day.||1 online resource||364.168|ebook - ebook|04/19/2022|2022-04-19|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008299781?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kNtDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Francis Fukuyama.|Political Order and Political Decay|Fukuyama, Francis|Fukuyama, Francis.|Francis Fukuyama|Nonfiction., History., Politics., Electronic books., Electronic book|History|The second volume of the bestselling landmark work on the history of the modern stateWriting in The Wall Street Journal, David Gress called Francis Fukuyama's Origins of Political Order magisterial in its learning and admirably immodest in its ambition. In The New York Times Book Review, Michael Lind described the book as a major achievement by one of the leading public intellectuals of our time. And in The Washington Post, Gerard DeGrott exclaimed this is a book that will be remembered. Bring on volume two. Volume two is finally here, completing the most important work of political thought in at least a generation. Taking up the essential question of how societies develop strong, impersonal, and accountable political institutions, Fukuyama follows the story from the French Revolution to the so-called Arab Spring and the deep dysfunctions of contemporary American politics. He examines the effects of corruption on governance, and why some societies have been successful at rooting it out. He explores the different legacies of colonialism in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, and offers a clear-eyed account of why some regions have thrived and developed more quickly than others. And he boldly reckons with the future of democracy in the face of a rising global middle class and entrenched political paralysis in the West. A sweeping, masterful account of the struggle to create a well-functioning modern state, Political Order and Political Decay is destined to be a classic.||1 online resource||320.1|ebook - ebook|09/30/2014|2014-09-30|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781429944328?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=j6hzAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Investigating philosophies from the Romantics, Nietzsche, Marx, Wilde, Freud, and the New Left, he outlines the history of Western thought to the distinctly sexual direction of present-day identity politics and explains the modern implications of these ideas on religion, free speech, and personal identity.    For fans of Trueman's The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self, this ebook offers a more concise presentation and application of some of the most critical topics of our day.

Erik Larson.|The Demon of Unrest: Abraham Lincoln & America’s Road to Civil War|Larson, Erik|Larson, Erik.|Erik Larson|Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., History., Military., Electronic books.|History|The internationally bestselling author of The Splendid and the Vile brings to life the pivotal five months between the election of Abraham Lincoln and the start of the Civil War—a slow-burning crisis that finally tore a deeply divided nation in two. On November 6, 1860, Abraham Lincoln became the fluky victor in a tight race for president. The country was bitterly at odds; Southern extremists were moving ever closer to destroying the Union, with one state after another seceding and Lincoln powerless to stop them. Slavery fuelled the conflict, but somehow the passions of North and South came to focus on a lonely federal fortress in Charleston Harbor: Fort Sumter. Master storyteller Erik Larson offers a gripping account of the chaotic months between Lincoln's election and the Confederacy's shelling of Sumter – a period marked by tragic errors and miscommunications, enflamed egos and craven ambitions, personal tragedies and betrayals. Lincoln himself wrote that the trials of these five months were 'so great that, could I have anticipated them, I would not have believed it possible to survive them'. At the heart of this suspense-filled narrative are Major Robert Anderson, Sumter's commander and a former slave owner sympathetic to the South but loyal to the Union; Edmund Ruffin, a vain and bloodthirsty radical who stirs secessionist ardour at every opportunity; and Mary Boykin Chesnut, wife of a prominent planter, conflicted over both marriage and slavery and seeing parallels between both. In the middle of it all is the overwhelmed Lincoln, battling with his duplicitous Secretary of State, William Seward, as he tries desperately to avert a war that he fears is inevitable – one that will eventually kill 750,000 Americans. Drawing on diaries, secret communiques, slave ledgers, and plantation records, Larson gives us a political horror story that captures the forces that led America to the brink – a dark reminder that we often don't see a cataclysm coming until it's too late.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|04/30/2024|2024-04-30|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008681777?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mbreEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In the 20th century, it was Americanized. Now, in the 21st century, the world is being Asianized.  The Asian Century is even bigger than you think. Far greater than just China, the new Asian system taking shape is a multi-civilizational order spanning Saudi Arabia to Japan, Russia to Australia, Turkey to Indonesia—linking five billion people through trade, finance, infrastructure, and diplomatic networks that together represent 40 percent of global GDP. China has taken a lead in building the new Silk Roads across Asia, but it will not lead it alone. Rather, Asia is rapidly returning to the centuries-old patterns of commerce, conflict, and cultural exchange that thrived long before European colonialism and American dominance. Asians will determine their own future—and as they collectively assert their interests around the world, they will determine ours as well.   There is no more important region of the world for us to better understand than Asia – and thus we cannot afford to keep getting Asia so wrong. Asia's complexity has led to common misdiagnoses: Western thinking on Asia conflates the entire region with China, predicts imminent World War III around every corner, and regularly forecasts debt-driven collapse for the region's major economies. But in reality, the region is experiencing a confident new wave of growth led by younger societies from India to the Philippines, nationalist leaders have put aside territorial disputes in favor of integration, and today's infrastructure investments are the platform for the next generation of digital innovation.   If the nineteenth century featured the Europeanization of the world, and the twentieth century its Americanization, then the twenty-first century is the time of Asianization. From investment portfolios and trade wars to Hollywood movies and university admissions, no aspect of life is immune from Asianization. With America's tech sector dependent on Asian talent and politicians praising Asia's glittering cities and efficient governments, Asia is permanently in our nation's consciousness. We know this will be the Asian century. Now we finally have an accurate picture of what it will look like.||1 online resource||330.95|ebook - ebook|02/05/2019|2019-02-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781501196270?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qDxqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

All over the world, an astonishing proportion of people now work for Western-style companies, study at Western-style universities, vote for Western-style governments, take Western medicines, wear Western clothes, and even work Western hours. Yet six hundred years ago the petty kingdoms of Western Europe seemed unlikely to achieve much more than perpetual internecine warfare. It was Ming China or Ottoman Turkey that had the look of world civilizations. How did the West overtake its Eastern rivals? And has the zenith of Western power now passed? In Civilization: The West and the Rest, bestselling author Niall Ferguson argues that, beginning in the fifteenth century, the West developed six powerful new concepts that the Rest lacked: competition, science, the rule of law, consumerism, modern medicine, and the work ethic. These were the killer applications that allowed the West to leap ahead of the Rest, opening global trade routes, exploiting newly discovered scientific laws, evolving a system of representative government, more than doubling life expectancy, unleashing the Industrial Revolution, and embracing a dynamic work ethic.

No dictator can rule through fear and violence alone. Naked power can be grabbed and held temporarily, but it never suffices in the long term. A tyrant who can compel his own people to acclaim him will last longer. The paradox of the modern dictator is that he must create the illusion of popular support. Throughout the twentieth century, hundreds of millions of people were condemned to enthusiasm, obliged to hail their leaders even as they were herded down the road to serfdom. In  How to Be a Dictator , Frank Dikötter returns to eight of the most chillingly effective personality cults of the twentieth century. From carefully choreographed parades to the deliberate cultivation of a shroud of mystery through iron censorship, these dictators ceaselessly worked on their own image and encouraged the population at large to glorify them. At a time when democracy is in retreat, are we seeing a revival of the same techniques among some of today's world leaders? This timely study, told with great narrative verve, examines how a cult takes hold, grows, and sustains itself. It places the cult of personality where it belongs, at the very heart of tyranny.||1 online resource||321.90904|ebook - ebook|07/09/2020|2020-07-09|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781526626981?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mX7dDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

A monolithic institution rooted in the past, many critics have claimed that it lacks the resources to adapt to modern society's needs and advances. In /Rethinking Christianity/, Keith Ward argues persuasively that this view is not only uncharitable, but refuted by historical evidence.  Mapping the evolution of six major beliefs, from the Hellenistic restatement to the challenged of evolutionary theory, Ward demonstrates that Christianity has always been expressed in constantly changing ways in response to new knowledge and understandings of the world. Controversial, liberal, and confronting the principal questions facing Christianity today, Ward uses this basis to support the construction of his own ground-breaking theology: a 'systematic theology' for the post-scientific age.||1 online resource||230|ebook - ebook|01/10/2013|2013-10-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781780744650?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PBy9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The FBI's pioneer of criminal profiling, former special agent John Douglas, has studied and interviewed many of America's most notorious killers-including Charles Manson, Son of Sam Killer David Berkowitz and BTK Strangler Dennis Rader-trained FBI agents and investigators around and the world, and helped educate the country about these deadly predators and how they operate, and has become a legend in popular culture, fictionalized in The Silence of the Lambs and the hit television shows Criminal Minds and Mindhunter.  Twenty years after his famous memoir, the man who literally wrote the book on FBI criminal profiling opens his case files once again. In this riveting work of true crime, he spotlights four of the most diabolical criminals he's confronted, interviewed and learned from. Going deep into each man's life and crimes, he outlines the factors that led them to murder and how he used his interrogation skills to expose their means, motives, and true evil. Like the hit Netflix show, The Killer Across the Table is centered around Douglas' unique interrogation and profiling process. With his longtime collaborator Mark Olshaker, Douglas recounts the chilling encounters with these four killers as he experienced them-revealing for the first time his profile methods in detail.   Going step by step through his interviews, Douglas explains how he connects each killer's crimes to the specific conversation, and contrasts these encounters with those of other deadly criminals to show what he learns from each one. In the process, he returns to other famous cases, killers and interviews that have shaped his career, describing how the knowledge he gained from those exchanges helped prepare him for these.  A glimpse into the mind of a man who has pierced the heart of human darkness, The Killer Across the Table unlocks the ultimate mystery of depravity and the techniques and approaches that have countered evil in the name of justice.||1 online resource||363.2595232|ebook - ebook|05/07/2019|2019-05-07|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062910653?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ALtnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Daron Acemoglu.|The Narrow Corridor|Acemoglu, Daron|Acemoglu, Daron.|Daron Acemoglu, James A. Robinson|Nonfiction., History., Politics., Electronic books.|Political Science|Why is it so difficult to develop and sustain liberal democracy? The best recent work on this subject comes from a remarkable pair of scholars, Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson. In their latest book,  The Narrow Corridor , they have answered this question with great insight. -Fareed Zakaria,    The Washington Post     From the authors of the international bestseller  Why Nations Fail , a crucial new big-picture framework that answers the question of how liberty flourishes in some states but falls to authoritarianism or anarchy in others—and explains how it can continue to thrive despite new threats.  In  Why Nations Fail , Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson argued that countries rise and fall based not on culture, geography, or chance, but on the power of their institutions. In their new book, they build a new theory about liberty and how to achieve it, drawing a wealth of evidence from both current affairs and disparate threads of world history.    Liberty is hardly the natural order of things. In most places and at most times, the strong have dominated the weak and human freedom has been quashed by force or by customs and norms. Either states have been too weak to protect individuals from these threats, or states have been too strong for people to protect themselves from despotism. Liberty emerges only when a delicate and precarious balance is struck between state and society.  There is a Western myth that political liberty is a durable construct, arrived at by a process of enlightenment. This static view is a fantasy, the authors argue. In reality, the corridor to liberty is narrow and stays open only via a fundamental and incessant struggle between state and society: The authors look to the American Civil Rights Movement, Europe’s early and recent history, the Zapotec civilization circa 500 BCE, and Lagos’s efforts to uproot corruption and institute government accountability to illustrate what it takes to get and stay in the corridor. But they also examine Chinese imperial history, colonialism in the Pacific, India’s caste system, Saudi Arabia’s suffocating cage of norms, and the “Paper Leviathan” of many Latin American and African nations to show how countries can drift away from it, and explain the feedback loops that make liberty harder to achieve.   Today we are in the midst of a time of wrenching destabilization. We need liberty more than ever, and yet the corridor to liberty is becoming narrower and more treacherous. The danger on the horizon is not just the loss of our political freedom, however grim that is in itself; it is also the disintegration of the prosperity and safety that critically depend on liberty. The opposite of the corridor of liberty is the road to ruin.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|09/24/2019|2019-09-24|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780735224391?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IHuDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In Adults in the Room, the renowned economist and former finance minister of Greece Yanis Varoufakis gives the full, blistering account of his momentous clash with the mightiest economic and political forces on earth. After being swept into power with the left-wing Syriza party, Varoufakis attempts to renegotiate Greece's relationship with the EU-and sparks a spectacular battle with global implications. Varoufakis's new position sends him ricocheting between mass demonstrations in Athens, closed-door negotiations in drab EU and IMF offices, and furtive meetings with power brokers in Washington, D.C. He consults and quarrels with Barack Obama, Emmanuel Macron, Christine Lagarde, the economists Larry Summers and Jeffrey Sachs, and others, as he struggles to resolve Greece's debt crisis without resorting to punishing austerity measures. But despite the mass support of the Greek people and the simple logic of Varoufakis's arguments, he succeeds only in provoking the fury of Europe's elite. Varoufakis's unvarnished memoir is an urgent warning that the economic policies once embraced by the EU and the White House have failed-and spawned authoritarianism, populist revolt, and instability throughout the Western world. Adults in the Room is an extraordinary tale of brinkmanship, hypocrisy, collusion, and betrayal that will shake the global establishment to its foundations.||1 online resource||337.142095|ebook - ebook|07/02/2024|2017-10-03|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780374718428?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LJUqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In this fascinating volume, Karen Armstrong, author of the highly praised A History of God, traces the history of how Jews, Christians, and Muslims have all laid claim to Jerusalem as their holy place, and how three radically different concepts of holiness have shaped and scarred the city for thousands of years.Armstrong unfolds a complex story of spiritual upheaval and political transformation--from King David's capital to an administrative outpost of the Roman Empire, from the cosmopolitan city sanctified by Christ to the spiritual center conquered and glorified by Muslims, from the gleaming prize of European Crusaders to the bullet-ridden symbol of the present-day Arab-Israeli conflict. Written with grace and clarity, the product of years of meticulous research, Jerusalem combines the pageant of history with the profundity of searching spiritual analysis. Like Karen Armstrong's A History of God, Jerusalem is a book for the ages.||1 online resource||956.9442|ebook - ebook|08/10/2011||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780307798596?s=MD|

Yet history is full of strategic decisions, big and small, that were ill-conceived, poorly organised and consequently disastrous. This updated guide looks at the whole process of strategic decision-making - from vision, forecasting, and resource allocation, through to implementation and innovation. Strategy is about understanding where you are now, where you are heading and how you will get there. There is no room for timidity or confusion. Although the CEO and the board decide a company's overall direction, it is the managers at all levels of the organisation that will determine how the vision can be transformed into action. In short, everyone is involved in strategy. But getting it right involves difficult choices: which customers to target, what products to offer and the best way to keep costs low and service high. And constantly changing business conditions inevitably bring risks. Even after business strategy has been developed, a company must remain nimble and alert to change, and view strategy as an ongoing and evolving process.The message of this guide is simple: strategy matters, and getting it right is fundamental to business success - this book will show you how.||1 online resource||362.7309561|ebook - ebook|03/26/2015|2015-03-26|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781782830429?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MHIZBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Martin Bunton.||Bunton, Martin|Bunton, Martin.||Nonfiction., Jewish-Arab relations, Arab-Israeli conflict, Politics., Electronic books.||The conflict between Palestine and Israel is one of the most highly publicized and bitter struggles in history. In this accessible and stimulating Very Short Introduction, Martin Bunton clearly explains the history of the problem, reducing it to its very essence-a modern territorial contest between two nations and one geographical territory. Adopting a fresh and original approach, each section covers a twenty-year span, to highlight the historical complexity of the conflict throughout successive decades. Each chapter starts with an examination of the relationships among people and events that marked particular years as historical moments in the evolution of the conflict, including the 1897 Basle Congress; the 1917 Balfour Declaration and British occupation of Palestine; and the 1947 UN Partition Plan and the war for Palestine. Providing a clear and fair exploration of the main issues, Bunton explores not only the historical basis of the conflict, but also looks at how and why partition has been so difficult and how efforts to restore peace continue today.About the Series: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

Terrence Gordon.||McLuhan, Marshall|McLuhan, Marshall||Mass media., Mass media, Nonfiction., Sociology., Electronic books., Gordon, W. Terrence, 1942- editor.||When first published, Marshall McLuhan's Understanding Media made history with its radical view of the effects of electronic communications upon man and life in the twentieth century. This edition of McLuhan's best-known book both enhances its accessibility to a general audience and provides the full critical apparatus necessary for scholars. In Terrence Gordon's own words, �McLuhan is in full flight already in the introduction, challenging us to plunge with him into what he calls 'the creative process of knowing.' Much to the chagrin of his contemporary critics McLuhan's preference was for a prose style that explored rather than explained. Probes, or aphorisms, were an indispensable tool with which he sought to prompt and prod the reader into an understanding of how media operate and to provoke reflection.  In the 1960s McLuhan's theories aroused both wrath and admiration. It is intriguing to speculate what he might have to say 40 years later on subjects to which he devoted whole chapters such as Television, The Telephone, Weapons, Housing and Money. Today few would dispute that mass media have indeed decentralized modern living and turned the world into a global village.  This critical edition features an appendix that makes available for the first time the core of the research project that spawned the book and individual chapter notes are supported by a glossary of terms, indices of subjects, names, and works cited. There is also a complete bibliography of McLuhan's published works.  W. Terrence Gordon is Associate General Editor of the Gingko Press McLuhan publishing program, author of the biography Marshall McLuhan: Escape into Understanding and McLuhan for Beginners.||1 online resource||302.230|ebook - ebook|06/14/2013||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781584235125?s=MD|

Jr Gerstner, Louis V.|Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?|Gerstner, Louis V.|Gerstner, Louis V, Jr.|Louis V. Gerstner, Jr.|Nonfiction., Business., Management., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|In 1990, IBM had its most profitable year ever. By 1993, the computer industry had changed so rapidly the company was on its way to losing $16 billion and IBM was on a watch list for extinction - victimized by its own lumbering size, an insular corporate culture, and the PC era IBM had itself helped invent.Then Lou Gerstner was brought in to run IBM. Almost everyone watching the rapid demise of this American icon presumed Gerstner had joined IBM to preside over its continued dissolution into a confederation of autonomous business units. This strategy, well underway when he arrived, would have effectively eliminated the corporation that had invented many of the industry's most important technologies.Instead, Gerstner took hold of the company and demanded the managers work together to re-establish IBM's mission as a customer-focused provider of computing solutions. Moving ahead of his critics, Gerstner made the hold decision to keep the company together, slash prices on his core product to keep the company competitive, and almost defiantly announced, The last thing IBM needs right now is a vision.Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? tells the story of IBM's competitive and cultural transformation. In his own words, Gerstner offers a blow-by-blow account of his arrival at the company and his campaign to rebuild the leadership team and give the workforce a renewed sense of purpose. In the process, Gerstner defined a strategy for the computing giant and remade the ossified culture bred by the company's own success.The first-hand story of an extraordinary turnaround, a unique case study in managing a crisis, and a thoughtful reflection on the computer industry and the principles of leadership, Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? sums up Lou Gerstner's historic business achievement. Taking readers deep into the world of IBM's CEO, Gerstner recounts the high-level meetings and explains the pressure-filled, no-turning-back decisions that had to be made. He also offers his hard-won conclusions about the essence of what makes a great company run.In the history of modern business, many companies have gone from being industry leaders to the verge of extinction. Through the heroic efforts of a new management team, some of those companies have even succeeded in resuscitating themselves and living on in the shadow of their former stature. But only one company has been at the pinnacle of an industry, fallen to near collapse, and then, beyond anyone's expectations, returned to set the agenda. That company is IBM.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|10/13/2009|2009-10-13|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780061756085?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WyDMM6bz8SMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Tripp Mickle.|After Steve|Mickle, Tripp|Mickle, Tripp|Tripp Mickle|Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., Business., Electronic books.|Biography & Autobiography|From the New York Times' Tripp Mickle, the dramatic, untold story inside Apple after the passing of Steve Jobs by following his top lieutenants-Jony Ive, the Chief Design Officer, and Tim Cook, the COO-turned-CEO-and how the fading of the former and the rise of the latter led to Apple losing its soul.   Steve Jobs called Jony Ive his spiritual partner at Apple. The London-born genius was the second-most powerful person at Apple and the creative force who most embodies Jobs's spirit, the man who designed the products adopted by hundreds of millions the world over: the iPod, iPad, MacBook Air, the iMac G3, and the iPhone. In the wake of his close collaborator's death, the chief designer wrestled with grief and initially threw himself into his work designing the new Apple headquarters and the Watch before losing his motivation in a company increasingly devoted more to margins than to inspiration.  In many ways, Cook was Ive's opposite. The product of a small Alabama town, he had risen through the ranks from the supply side of the company. His gift was not the creation of new products. Instead, he had invented countless ways to maximize a margin, squeezing some suppliers, persuading others to build factories the size of cities to churn out more units. He considered inventory evil. He knew how to make subordinates sweat with withering questions.  Jobs selected Cook as his successor, and Cook oversaw a period of tremendous revenue growth that has lifted Apple's valuation to $2 trillion. He built a commanding business in China and rapidly distinguished himself as a master politician who could forge global alliances and send the world's stock market into freefall with a single sentence.  Author Tripp Mickle spoke with more than 200 current and former Apple executives, as well as figures key to this period of Apple's history, including Trump administration officials and fashion luminaries such as Anna Wintour while writing After Steve. His research shows the company's success came at a cost. Apple lost its innovative spirit and has not designed a new category of device in years. Ive's departure in 2019 marked a culmination in Apple's shift from a company of innovation to one of operational excellence, and the price is a company that has lost its soul.||1 online resource||338.7610041|ebook - ebook|05/03/2022|2022-05-03|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780063009837?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M0I7EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Katherine Clarke.|Billionaires' Row|Clarke, Katherine|Clarke, Katherine.|Katherine Clarke|Nonfiction., Architecture., Biography & Autobiography., Business., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|A fly-on-the-wall account of the ferocious ambition, greed, and financial one-upmanship behind the most expensive real estate in the world: the new Manhattan megatowers known as Billionaires’ Row—from a staff reporter at  The Wall Street Journal    “Deeply informative, delightfully entertaining, and addictively readable.”—Diana B. Henriques, bestselling author of  The Wizard of Lies    To look south and skyward from Central Park these days is to gaze upon a physical manifestation of tens of billions of dollars in global wealth: a series of soaring spires stretching from Park Avenue to Broadway. Known as Billionaires’ Row, this set of slender high-rise residences has transformed the skyline of New York City, thanks to developer-friendly policies and a seemingly endless gush of cash from tech, finance, and foreign oligarchs. And chances are most of us will never be invited to step inside. In  Billionaires’ Row,  Katherine Clarke reveals the captivating story of how, in just a few years, the ruthless real-estate impresarios behind these “supertalls” lining 57th Street turned what was once a run-down strip of Midtown into the most exclusive street on Earth, as legendary Trump-era veterans went toe-to-toe with hungry upstart developers in an ego-fueled “race to the sky.” Based on far-reaching access to real estate’s power players, Clarke’s account brings readers inside one of the world’s most cutthroat industries, showing how a combination of ferocious ambition and relentless salesmanship has created a new market of $100 million apartments for the world’s one-percenters—units to live in or, sometimes, just places to stash their cash. Filled with eye-popping stories that bring the new era of extreme wealth inequality into vivid relief,  Billionaires’ Row  is a juicy, gimlet-eyed account of the genius, greed, and financial one-upmanship behind the most expensive real estate in the world—a stranger-than-fiction saga of broken partnerships, broken marriages, lawsuits, and, for a few, fleeting triumph.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|06/13/2023|2023-06-13|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593240076?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=USaJEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

J Sai Deepak.|India, Bharat and Pakistan|Deepak, J Sai|Deepak, J Sai.|J Sai Deepak|Nonfiction., Law., Electronic books.|Law|India, Bharat and Pakistan , the second book of the Bharat Trilogy, takes the discussion forward from its bestselling predecessor,  India That Is Bharat.  It explores the combined influence of European and Middle Eastern colonialities on Bharat as the successor state to the Indic civilisation, and on the origins of the Indian Constitution. To this end, the book traces the thought continuum of Middle Eastern coloniality, from the rise of Islamic Revivalism in the 1740s following the decline of the Mughal Empire, which presaged the idea of Pakistan, until the end of the Khilafat Movement in 1924, which cemented the road to Pakistan. The book also describes the collaboration of convenience that was forged between the proponents of Middle Eastern coloniality and the British colonial establishment to the detriment of the Indic civilisation.   One of the objectives of this book is to help the reader draw parallels between the challenges faced by the Indic civilisation in the tumultuous period from 1740 to 1924, and the present day. Its larger goal remains the same as that of the first, which is to enthuse Bharatiyas to undertake a critical decolonial study of Bharat's history, especially in the context of the Constitution, so that the religiosity towards the document is moderated by a sense of proportion, perspective and purpose.|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|08/23/2022|2022-08-23|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9789354354526?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dKaAEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Perarnau's insights are astonishing' - Graham Hunter 'Write about everything you see. Be as critical as you like' - Pep Guardiola to Martí Perarnau, Summer 2013 Martí Perarnau was given total access to Bayern Munich during season 2013-14. This book represents the first time in the modern era that a writer has got this close to one of the elite teams of world football. At the invitation of Pep Guardiola, he shadowed the Catalan, his staff and his superstar players during training and on matchdays. Bayer smashed domestic records on their way to the double, but were humiliated by Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final. Perarnau was with them every step of the way. Perarnau is with Guardiola as he is courted by the world's greatest clubs during his sabbatical in New York. We hear Guardiola explain in detail the radical tactical moves which transform Bayern's season and reprogramme the players who will win the World Cup with Germany. Perarnau talks exclusively and in fascinating detail with an array of players, including Arjen Robben, Manuel Neuer, Philipp Lahm, Thiago Alc?ntara and Bastian Schweinsteiger. Pep Confidential is much more than the story of a season - it is also a lasting portrait of one of the greatest coaches in sport.||1 online resource||796.334092|ebook - ebook|10/16/2014|2014-10-16|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780857908179?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HJ68BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Read a succinct account of the philosophy of Schopenhauer in just one hour. Arthur Schopenhauer, the 'philosopher of pessimism,' makes it clear that he regards the world and our life in it as a bad joke. However, if the world is indifferent to our fate it doesn't thwart us deliberately – its façade is supported by what Schopenhauer calls the universal Will. He saw this as a force that is blind and without purpose, bringing on all our misery and suffering. Schopenhauer taught that our only hope is to liberate ourselves from the terrible power of the Will and from the trappings of individualism and egoism that are at its mercy. Here is a concise, expert account of Schopenhauer's life and philosophical ideas – entertainingly written and easy to understand. Also included are selections from Schopenhauer's work, suggested further reading, and chronologies that place Schopenhauer in the context of the broader scheme of philosophy.|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|07/05/2012||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780007466269?s=MD|

Born from the ashes of imperial domination, partition and a devastating war, back in the 1950s there were real doubts about its survival as an independent state. Yet South Korea endures: today it is a boisterous democracy, a vibrant market economy, a tech powerhouse, and home to the coolest of cultures. In just seventy years, this society has grown from a shrimp into a whale.  What explains this extraordinary transformation? For some, it was individual South Koreans who fought to change their country, and still strive to shape it. For others, it was forward-looking political and business leaders with a vision. Either way, it's clear that this is the story of a people who dreamt big, and whose dreams came true.  Shrimp to Whale is a lively history of South Korea, from its millennia-old roots, through the division of the Peninsula, dictatorship and economic growth, to today's global powerhouse.||1 online resource||951.9504|ebook - ebook|05/23/2022|2022-05-23|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781787388741?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c_dwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Simon Sebag Montefiore.|The Romanovs|Montefiore, Simon Sebag|Montefiore, Simon Sebag.|Simon Sebag Montefiore|Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., History., Politics., Electronic books., Electronic book|History|The Romanovs were the most successful dynasty of modern times, ruling a sixth of the world's surface for three centuries. How did one family turn a war-ruined principality into the world's greatest empire? And how did they lose it all?  This is the intimate story of twenty tsars and tsarinas, some touched by genius, some by madness, but all inspired by holy autocracy and imperial ambition. Simon Sebag Montefiore's gripping chronicle reveals their secret world of unlimited power and ruthless empire-building, overshadowed by palace conspiracy, family rivalries, sexual decadence and wild extravagance, with a global cast of adventurers, courtesans, revolutionaries and poets, from Ivan the Terrible to Tolstoy and Pushkin, to Bismarck, Lincoln, Queen Victoria and Lenin. To rule Russia was both imperial-sacred mission and poisoned chalice: six of the last twelve tsars were murdered. Peter the Great tortured his own son to death while making Russia an empire, and dominated his court with a dining club notable for compulsory drunkenness, naked dwarfs and fancy dress. Catherine the Great overthrew her own husband (who was murdered soon afterward), enjoyed affairs with a series of young male favorites, conquered Ukraine and fascinated Europe. Paul I was strangled by courtiers backed by his own son, Alexander I, who in turn faced Napoleon's invasion and the burning of Moscow, then went on to take Paris. Alexander II liberated the serfs, survived five assassination attempts and wrote perhaps the most explicit love letters ever composed by a ruler. The Romanovs climaxes with a fresh, unforgettable portrayal of Nicholas II and Alexandra, the rise and murder of Rasputin, war and revolution—and the harrowing massacre of the entire family.Dazzlingly entertaining and beautifully written from start to finish, The Romanovs brings these monarchs—male and female, great and flawed, their families and courts—blazingly to life. Drawing on new archival research, Montefiore delivers an enthralling epic of triumph and tragedy, love and murder, encompassing the seminal years 1812, 1914 and 1917, that is both a universal study of power and a portrait of empire that helps define Russia today.||1 online resource||947.099|ebook - ebook|05/03/2016|2016-05-03|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781101946978?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o9RfCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Sonja said. Yes, mommy, I remember, he said. That's where the angels sang to me.When Colton Burpo made it through an emergency appendectomy, his family was overjoyed at his miraculous survival. What they weren't expecting, though, was the story that emerged in the months that followed-a story as beautiful as it was extraordinary, detailing their little boy's trip to heaven and back.Colton, not yet four years old, told his parents he left his body during the surgery-and authenticated that claim by describing exactly what his parents were doing in another part of the hospital while he was being operated on. He talked of visiting heaven and relayed stories told to him by people he met there whom he had never met in life, sharing events that happened even before he was born. He also astonished his parents with descriptions and obscure details about heaven that matched the Bible exactly, though he had not yet learned to read.With disarming innocence and the plainspoken boldness of a child, Colton tells of meeting long-departed family members. He describes Jesus, the angels, how really, really big God is, and how much God loves us. Retold by his father, but using Colton's uniquely simple words, Heaven Is for Real offers a glimpse of the world that awaits us, where as Colton says, Nobody is old and nobody wears glasses.Heaven Is for Real will forever change the way you think of eternity, offering the chance to see, and believe, like a child., Text Difficulty 5, MG+/Upper middle grades (6th-12th), 6.3 ATOS Level||1 online resource||133.9013092|ebook - ebook|10/31/2011|2011-10-31|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780849949203?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W_5-RKxftbcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Occupying a precarious middle ground between the Jewish citizens of Israel and the dispossessed Palestinians of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Israeli Palestinians have developed an exceedingly complex relationship with the land they call home; however, in the innumerable discussions of the Israel-Palestine problem, their experiences are often overlooked and forgotten.In this book, historian Ilan Pappé examines how Israeli Palestinians have fared under Jewish rule and what their lives tell us about both Israel's attitude toward minorities and Palestinians' attitudes toward the Jewish state. Drawing upon significant archival and interview material, Pappé analyzes the Israeli state's policy towards its Palestinian citizens, finding discrimination in matters of housing, education, and civil rights.

Mearsheimer|Nonfiction., Philosophy., Politics., Electronic books.|Political Science|A renowned scholar argues that liberal hegemony—the policy America has pursued since the Cold War ended—is doomed to fail   Named a  Financial Times  Best Book of 2018   Idealists as well as realists need to read this systematic tour de force.—Robert D. Kaplan, author of    The Return of Marco Polo's World    It is widely believed in the West that the United States should spread liberal democracy across the world, foster an open international economy, and build international institutions. The policy of remaking the world in America's image is supposed to protect human rights, promote peace, and make the world safe for democracy. But this is not what has happened. Instead, the United States has become a highly militarized state fighting wars that undermine peace, harm human rights, and threaten liberal values at home.    In this major statement, the renowned international-relations scholar John Mearsheimer argues that liberal hegemony—the foreign policy pursued by the United States since the Cold War ended—is doomed to fail. It makes far more sense, he maintains, for Washington to adopt a more restrained foreign policy based on a sound understanding of how nationalism and realism constrain great powers abroad.  The Great Delusion  is a lucid and compelling work of the first importance for scholars, policymakers, and everyone interested in the future of American foreign policy.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|09/10/2018|2018-09-25|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780300240535?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ExttDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Bill Hayton.|Brief History of Vietnam|Hayton, Bill|Hayton, Bill.|Bill Hayton|Nonfiction., History., Sociology., Electronic books.|History|A comprehensive guide to understanding Vietnam's long and tumultuous history    A Brief History of Vietnam  explores the turbulent history of a land that has risen from the ashes of war to become the newest Asian tiger economy. This book expertly examines the history of a people and a nation with ancient roots which only took its current shape in the 19th century under French colonial rule, and its current name in 1945. Before that, Vietnam was known by many names, under many rulers. Located in the geographic center of Southeast Asia, the country we call Vietnam was ruled by China, then by a series of Vietnamese emperors, and by the French. A devastating, decades-long conflict for independence ensued, ending with the conclusion of the Vietnam War in 1975. Key topics discussed in this fascinating book include:  China's ancient conquest of Vietnam and the millennia-long struggle of the Vietnamese for independence from their powerful neighbor to the north  The reign of the Nguyen dynasty, the last dynasty to rule Vietnam, with its capital at the ancient city of Hue, today a UNESCO World Heritage Site  The story of Ho Chi Minh, educated in France, who attended the Treaty of Versailles to advocate for independence and became Vietnam's first president after the French were defeated  The country's miraculous emergence from three decades of war and how it has embarked on the path to becoming one of the world's fastest-growing economies today   Journalist Bill Hayton's accessible prose makes  A Brief History of Vietnam  an essential study of a complex culture at the heart of Southeast Asia-and the roots of its current economic dynamism.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|10/25/2022|2022-10-25|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781462923267?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lfdwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Robert D Kaplan.|The Loom of Time|Kaplan, Robert D.|Kaplan, Robert D.|Robert D. Kaplan|Nonfiction., History., Politics., Electronic books.|History|A stunning exploration of the Greater Middle East, where lasting stability has often seemed just out of reach but may hold the key to the shifting world order of the twenty-first century Continuing Robert D. Kaplan's work as the premier American scholar of geopolitics . . . a book that everyone who wants to understand the real forces that decide war and peace should read.-John Gray, author of  The New Leviathans: Thoughts After Liberalism     The Greater Middle East, which Robert D. Kaplan defines as the vast region between the Mediterranean and China, encompassing much of the Arab world, parts of northern Africa, and Asia, existed for millennia as the crossroads of empire: Macedonian, Roman, Persian, Mongol, Ottoman, British, Soviet, American. But with the dissolution of empires in the twentieth century, postcolonial states have endeavored to maintain stability in the face of power struggles between factions, leadership vacuums, and the arbitrary borders drawn by exiting imperial rulers with little regard for geography or political groups on the ground. In the  Loom of Time , Kaplan explores this broad, fraught space through reporting and travel writing to reveal deeper truths about the impacts of history on the present and how the requirements of stability over anarchy are often in conflict with the ideals of democratic governance.  In  The Loom of Time , Kaplan makes the case for realism as an approach to the Greater Middle East. Just as Western attempts at democracy promotion across the Middle East have failed, a new form of economic imperialism is emerging today as China's ambitions fall squarely within the region as the key link between Europe and East Asia. As in the past, the Greater Middle East will be a register of future great power struggles across the globe. And like in the past, thousands of years of imperial rule will continue to cast a long shadow on politics as it is practiced today.  To piece together the history of this remarkable place and what it suggests for the future, Kaplan weaves together classic texts, immersive travel writing, and a great variety of voices from every country that all compel the reader to look closely at the realities on the ground and to prioritize these facts over ideals on paper.  The Loom of Time  is a challenging, clear-eyed book that promises to reframe our vision of the global twenty-first century.||1 online resource||327.56058|ebook - ebook|08/22/2023|2023-08-22|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593242803?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yf-gEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

A brilliant feat of storytelling, monumental in scope, yet put together with tenderness for a man who had always believed that he would be Britain's savior. - Wall Street Journal   In this landmark biography of Winston Churchill based on extensive new material, the true genius of the man, statesman and leader can finally be fully seen and understood-by the bestselling, award-winning author of  Napoleon  and  The Last King of America.    When we seek an example of great leaders with unalloyed courage, the person who comes to mind is Winston Churchill: the iconic, visionary war leader immune from the consensus of the day, who stood firmly for his beliefs when everyone doubted him. But how did young Winston become Churchill? What gave him the strength to take on the superior force of Nazi Germany when bombs rained on London and so many others had caved? In  Churchill,  Andrew Roberts gives readers the full and definitive Winston Churchill, from birth to lasting legacy, as personally revealing as it is compulsively readable.  Roberts gained exclusive access to extensive new material: transcripts of War Cabinet meetings, diaries, letters and unpublished memoirs from Churchill's contemporaries. The Royal Family permitted Roberts-in a first for a Churchill biographer-to read the detailed notes taken by King George VI in his diary after his weekly meetings with Churchill during World War II. This treasure trove of access allows Roberts to understand the man in revelatory new ways, and to identify the hidden forces fueling Churchill's legendary drive.  We think of Churchill as a hero who saved civilization from the evils of Nazism and warned of the grave crimes of Soviet communism, but Roberts's masterwork reveals that he has as much to teach us about the challenges leaders face today-and the fundamental values of courage, tenacity, leadership and moral conviction.||1 online resource||941.084092|ebook - ebook|11/06/2018|2018-11-06|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781101981016?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r4RLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Dan Jones covers a thousand years of history with elegance and panache'  Dan Carlin, Hardcore History    'Dan Jones is in a class of his own ... Read this book to wrap your head around 1,000 years of history with as much ease and enjoyment as relaxing into a good novel'  Professor Suzannah Lipscomb    'A terrifically colourful and compelling narrative history ... Bustling and sizzling with life on every page'   Sunday Times     'A badass history writer... to put it mildly'  Duff McKagan   Dan Jones's epic new history tells nothing less than the story of how the world we know today came to be built. It is a thousand-year adventure that moves from the ruins of the once-mighty city of Rome, sacked by barbarians in AD 410, to the first contacts between the old and new worlds in the sixteenth century. It shows how, from a state of crisis and collapse, the West was rebuilt and came to dominate the entire globe. The book identifies three key themes that underpinned the success of the West: commerce, conquest and Christianity.   Across 16 chapters, blending Dan Jones's trademark gripping narrative style with authoritative analysis,  Powers and Thrones  shows how, at each stage in this story, successive western powers thrived by attracting - or stealing - the most valuable resources, ideas and people from the rest of the world. It casts new light on iconic locations - Rome, Paris, Venice, Constantinople - and it features some of history's most famous and notorious men and women.   This is a book written about - and for - an age of profound change, and it asks the biggest questions about the West both then and now. Where did we come from? What made us? Where do we go from here?

At the approach of the first millennium, the Christians of Europe did not seem likely candidates for future greatness. Weak, fractured, and hemmed in by hostile nations, they saw no future beyond the widely anticipated Second Coming of Christ. But when the world did not end, the peoples of Western Europe suddenly found themselves with no choice but to begin the heroic task of building a Jerusalem on earth. In  The Forge of Christendom , Tom Holland masterfully describes this remarkable new age, a time of caliphs and Viking sea kings, the spread of castles and the invention of knighthood. It was one of the most significant departure points in history: the emergence of Western Europe as a distinctive and expansionist power.||1 online resource||270.2|ebook - ebook|05/05/2009|2009-05-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780385530200?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=USSMpa29Q4MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Not a reassuring story' – Sir John Scarlett, former Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6)   Written by Dr Sung-Yoon Lee ,  a scholar and specialist on North Korea who has advised the US government,    The Sister  is a jaw-dropping account of the spectacular rise of Kim Yo Jong, de-facto deputy to her brother, Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, and the most powerful woman in North Korea.  In 2022, in a particularly fiery speech, Kim Yo Jong threatened to nuke South Korea, reminding the world of the dangers posed by her state. But how did the youngest daughter of Dear Leader Kim Jong Il, his 'sweet princess', become the ruthless chief propagandist, internal administrator and foreign policymaker for her brother's totalitarian regime?  The Sister  uncovers the truth about Kim Yo Jong, her close bond with Kim Jong Un and the lessons in manipulation they learned from their father. He also examines the iron grip the Kim dynasty has on their country, the grotesque deaths of family members deemed disloyal, and the signs that Kim Yo Jong has been positioned as her brother's successor should he die while his own children are young. Readable and insightful, this book is an invaluable portrait of a woman who might yet hold the survival of her despotic dynasty in her hands.

It is ideal for university students and adult learners with plentiful reading texts and written exercises, all in Korean Hangul. Concise Korean grammar notes in English, extensive glossaries, and an answer key make this book suitable for those studying alone, as well as for classroom use. There are 20 comprehensive lessons, each with a reading text in which new language is introduced in context, followed by vocabulary, grammar points, and exercises. Lessons 5, 10, 15 and 20 are short reviews of the key structural patterns introduced. The focus is on written Korean, but the reading texts are not academic, they are breezy, chatty, and amusing, with illustrations. The textbook comes with downloadable material entitled Sino-Korean Companion, a supplement for those learners wishing to commence the study of Chinese characters as they are used in the Korean language. The 20 lessons build on the content of the lessons in the main textbook to introduce 500 Chinese characters in their Sino-Korean readings. The emphasis is on giving students the tools they need to decipher unfamiliar Chinese characters on their own, and also on Sino-Korean vocabulary acquisition. Each lesson introduces approximately 25-30 new Chinese characters along with related vocabulary items, and builds on previous characters and vocabulary introduced, demonstrating the cumulative effect on one's vocabulary of paying systematic attention to Sino-Korean.||1 online resource||495.783421|ebook - ebook|04/07/2015||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781462915088?s=MD|

This is a philosophy to be reckoned with, both for its own intrinsic power and as a profound symptom of our time ( The New York Times ).  In 1943, Jean-Paul Sartre published his masterpiece,  Being and Nothingness , and laid the foundation of his legacy as one of the greatest twentieth century philosophers. A brilliant and radical account of the human condition,  Being and Nothingness  explores what gives our lives significance.   In a new, more accessible translation, this foundational text argues that we alone create our values and our existence is characterized by freedom and the inescapability of choice. Far from being an internal, passive container for our thoughts and experiences, human consciousness is constantly projecting itself into the outside world and imbuing it with meaning.   Now with a new foreword by Harvard professor of philosophy Richard Moran, this clear-eyed translation guarantees that the groundbreaking ideas that Sartre introduced in this resonant work will continue to inspire for generations to come.||1 online resource||111.5|ebook - ebook|09/07/2021|2021-09-07|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781982105464?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Xj5qDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

For thousands of years flags have represented our hopes and dreams. We wave them. Burn them. March under their colours. And still, in the 21st century, we die for them. Flags fly at the UN, on the Arab street, from front porches in Texas. They represent the politics of high power as well as the politics of the mob.

In nine chapters (covering the USA, UK, Europe, Middle East, Asia, Africa, Latin America, international flags and flags of terror), Tim Marshall draws on more than twenty-five years of global reporting experience to reveal the histories, the power and the politics of the symbols that unite us - and divide us.||1 online resource||929.920|ebook - ebook|09/22/2016|2016|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781783962822?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7vJlAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

One by one, the sacred canons of right and left are obliterated. The war is laid bare, with all its uncomfortable truths exposed' The Times 'An altogether magnificent historical narrative.' Tim O'Brien Vietnam became the Western world's most divisive modern conflict, precipitating a battlefield humiliation for France in 1954, then a vastly greater one for the United States in 1975. Max Hastings has spent the past three years interviewing scores of participants on both sides, as well as researching a multitude of American and Vietnamese documents and memoirs, to create an epic narrative of an epic struggle. He portrays the set pieces of Dienbienphu, the Tet offensive, the air blitz of North Vietnam, and less familiar battles such as the bloodbath at Daido, where a US Marine battalion was almost wiped out, together with extraordinary recollections of Ho Chi Minh's warriors. Here are the vivid realities of strife amid jungle and paddies that killed 2 million people. Many writers treat the war as a US tragedy, yet Hastings sees it as overwhelmingly that of the Vietnamese people, of whom forty died for every American. US blunders and atrocities were matched by those committed by their enemies. While all the world has seen the image of a screaming, naked girl seared by napalm, it forgets countless eviscerations, beheadings and murders carried out by the communists. The people of both former Vietnams paid a bitter price for the Northerners' victory in privation and oppression. Here is testimony from Vietcong guerrillas, Southern paratroopers, Saigon bargirls and Hanoi students alongside that of infantrymen from South Dakota, Marines from North Carolina, Huey pilots from Arkansas. No past volume has blended a political and military narrative of the entire conflict with heart-stopping personal experiences, in the fashion that Max Hastings' readers know so well. The author suggests that neither side deserved to win this struggle with so many lessons for the 21st century about the misuse of military might to confront intractable political and cultural challenges. He marshals testimony from warlords and peasants, statesmen and soldiers, to create an extraordinary record.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|09/20/2018|2018-09-20|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008133009?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uBBTDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Trained in philosophy in North America and Asia, and well-experienced in real politik as a diplomat on the world stage, Mahbubani has unusual insight into America's ever more troubled relationship with the rest of the world.   In  Beyond the Age of Innocence  Mahbubani reveals to us the America that Asia and the rest of the world see. We are a country that has given hope to billions by creating a society where destiny is not determined at birth. After the Second World War, we created a global order which allowed many nations to flourish. But when the Cold War ended, America made a terrible mistake. We started behaving like a normal country, ignoring the plight of others, indifferent to the consequences of our decisions on others. America was imprudent in its policy towards two large masses of mankind: the Chinese and Muslim populations. Guantanamo damaged our moral authority, but Abu Ghraib, paradoxically, may have demonstrated the accountability of American institutions. Still, disillusionment with America has spread to all corners.   To allow any lasting gap between America and the world, Mahbubani argues, would be a colossal strategic mistake for America and a huge loss to the world. But there is still time for the US to change course; and in this thought-provoking, visionary book, Mahbubani shows us how.||1 online resource||327.7300905|ebook - ebook|04/24/2009|2009-04-24|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780786736638?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gQOoKDgG8wIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Christopher R Browning.|Ordinary Men|Browning, Christopher R.|Browning, Christopher R.|Christopher R. Browning|Nonfiction., History., Military., Electronic books.|Social Science|Christopher R. Browning's shocking account of how a unit of average middle-aged Germans became the cold-blooded murderers of tens of thousands of Jews-now with a new afterword and additional photographs. Ordinary Men is the true story of Reserve Police Battalion 101 of the German Order Police, which was responsible for mass shootings as well as round-ups of Jewish people for deportation to Nazi death camps in Poland in 1942. Browning argues that most of the men of RPB 101 were not fanatical Nazis but, rather, ordinary middle-aged, working-class men who committed these atrocities out of a mixture of motives, including the group dynamics of conformity, deference to authority, role adaptation, and the altering of moral norms to justify their actions. Very quickly three groups emerged within the battalion: a core of eager killers, a plurality who carried out their duties reliably but without initiative, and a small minority who evaded participation in the acts of killing without diminishing the murderous efficiency of the battalion whatsoever.While this book discusses a specific Reserve Unit during WWII, the general argument Browning makes is that most people succumb to the pressures of a group setting and commit actions they would never do of their own volition. Ordinary Men is a powerful, chilling, and important work with themes and arguments that continue to resonate today.A remarkable-and singularly chilling-glimpse of human behavior...This meticulously researched book...represents a major contribution to the literature of the Holocaust.-Newsweek||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|02/28/2017|2017-02-28|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062303035?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C3Q1DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

But those who use the same words do not always present the same meanings. Clarifying those meanings is the first step toward finding out what we agree on and disagree on. From there, it is largely a question of what the facts are.  Social Justice Fallacies  reveals how many things that are thought to be true simply cannot stand up to documented facts, which are often the opposite of what is widely believed.  However attractive the social justice  vision , the crucial question is whether the social justice  agenda  will get us to the fulfillment of that vision. History shows that the social justice agenda has often led in the opposite direction, sometimes with catastrophic consequences.   More things are involved besides simply mistakes. All human beings are fallible, and social justice advocates may not necessarily make any more mistakes than others. But crusaders with an utter certainty about their mission are often undeterred by obstacles, evidence or even fatal dangers. That is where much of the Western world is today. The question is whether we will continue on heedlessly, past the point of no return.||1 online resource||320.011|ebook - ebook|09/19/2023|2023-09-19|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781541603936?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rJOWEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Combining charming descriptions of family and community life with a sense of humor and intense devotion to God, it was an instant bestseller. But earlier editions often excluded passages, and refined her use of the French dialect often spoken by peasants. This remarkable new translation includes every word of the original text, retaining the complete charm of the original. The result is a complete and unabridged work, longer than most other editions available today. Millions of hearts have been touched by St. Thérèse of Lisieux's desire, not to be mighty and great, but to be a humble, little flower that would gladden God's eyes as He glances down at His feet. Now, yours will be, too.

China is the sole exception, and it is fast emerging into a global superpower that could rival, if not eclipse, the United States. What does China want, does it have a grand strategy to achieve it, and what should the United States do about it? In The Long Game, Rush Doshi draws from a rich base of Chinese primary sources, including decades worth of party documents, leaked materials, memoirs by party leaders, and a careful analysis of China's conduct to provide a history of China's grand strategy since the end of the Cold War. Taking readers behind the Party's closed doors, he uncovers Beijing's long, methodical game to displace America from its hegemonic position in both the East Asia regional and global orders through three sequential strategies of displacement. Beginning in the 1980s, China focused for two decades on hiding capabilities and biding time. After the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, it became more assertive regionally, following a policy of actually accomplishing something. Finally, in the aftermath populist elections of 2016, China shifted to a more even more aggressive strategy for undermining US hegemony, adopting the phrase great changes unseen in century. After charting how China's long game has evolved, Doshi offers a comprehensive yet asymmetric plan for an effective US response. Ironically, his proposed approach takes a page from Beijing's own strategic playbook to undermine China's ambitions and strengthen American order without competing dollar-for-dollar, ship-for-ship, or loan-for-loan.||1 online resource||327.510|ebook - ebook|06/11/2021||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780197527924?s=MD|

Peter Schweizer.|Blood Money|Schweizer, Peter|Schweizer, Peter.|Peter Schweizer|Nonfiction., Politics., Electronic books.|Political Science|AN INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER    It's often said that China is in a cold war with America. The reality is far worse: the war is hot, and the body count is one-sided.   China is killing Americans and working aggres­sively to maximize the carnage while our leaders remain passive and, in some cases, compliant. Why?  If anyone could crack the code, it's the renowned nonpartisan investigator Peter Schweizer. Schweizer's previous three number one New York Times bestsellers sent shock waves through official Wash­ington, sparking FBI investigations and congres­sional probes that continue to this day.  For Blood Money, Schweizer and his team of forensic investigators spent more than two years scouring a trove of restricted Chinese military documents, data-mining a mountain of American financial records, and tracking US political lead­ers' investments and family businesses. Schweizer unloads bombshell after bombshell, exposing the Chinese Communist Party's covert operations in the American drug trade, social justice movement, and medical establishment to sow chaos and deca­dence in the United States.  A towering achievement of investigative jour­nalism, Blood Money is one of those rare books that makes you clearly see the world anew.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|02/27/2024|2024-02-27|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780063061217?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pt-5EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Was there an illegal immigrant who couldn't be deported because he had a pet cat? Are unelected judges truly enemies of the people?    Most of us think the law is only relevant to criminals, if we even think of it at all. But the law touches every area of our lives: from intimate family matters to the biggest issues in our society.  Our unfamiliarity is dangerous because it makes us vulnerable to media spin, political lies and the kind of misinformation that frequently comes from loud-mouthed amateurs and those with vested interests. This 'fake law' allows the powerful and the ignorant to corrupt justice without our knowledge - worse, we risk letting them make us complicit.   Thankfully, the Secret Barrister is back to reveal the stupidity, malice and incompetence behind many of the biggest legal stories of recent years.

Ward Farnsworth.|The Legal Analyst|Farnsworth, Ward|Farnsworth, Ward.|Ward Farnsworth|Nonfiction., Law., Electronic books.|Law|There are two kinds of knowledge law school teaches: legal rules on the one hand, and tools for thinking about legal problems on the other. Although the tools are far more interesting and useful than the rules, they tend to be neglected in favor of other aspects of the curriculum. In  The Legal Analyst , Ward Farnsworth brings together in one place all of the most powerful of those tools for thinking about law.    From classic ideas in game theory such as the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Stag Hunt to psychological principles such as hindsight bias and framing effects, from ideas in jurisprudence such as the slippery slope to more than two dozen other such principles, Farnsworth's guide leads readers through the fascinating world of legal thought. Each chapter introduces a single tool and shows how it can be used to solve different types of problems. The explanations are written in clear, lively language and illustrated with a wide range of examples.     The Legal Analyst  is an indispensable user's manual for law students, experienced practitioners seeking a one-stop guide to legal principles, or anyone else with an interest in the law.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|09/15/2008|2024-05-31|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780226238364?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=slj9yJt1_JcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

How do elites maintain their dominant position? And why do ruling classes sometimes suddenly lose their grip on power?  For decades, complexity scientist Peter Turchin has been studying world history like no-one else. Assembling vast databases mined from 10,000 years of human activity, and then developing new models, he has transformed the way we learn from the past.  End Times  is the result: a ground-breaking account of how society works. The lessons, he argues, are clear. When the balance of power between the ruling class and the majority tips too far in favour of elites, income inequality surges. The rich get richer, the poor further impoverished. As more people try to join the elite, frustration with the establishment brims over, often with disastrous consequences. Elite overproduction led to state breakdown in imperial China, in medieval France, in the American Civil War - and it is happening now. But while we are far along the path toward violent political rupture, Turchin's models also light the way to a brighter future. Drawing insight from those occasions in history where the balance was restored,  End Times  also points towards a different future: an escape from the patterns of the past.

To answer these questions, the anthropologist David Graeber--one of our most important and provocative thinkers--traces the peculiar and unexpected ways we relate to bureaucracy today, and reveals how it shapes our lives in ways we may not even notice...though he also suggests that there may be something perversely appealing--even romantic--about bureaucracy.    Leaping from the ascendance of right-wing economics to the hidden meanings behind Sherlock Holmes and Batman, The Utopia of Rules is at once a powerful work of social theory in the tradition of Foucault and Marx, and an entertaining reckoning with popular culture that calls to mind Slavoj Zizek at his most accessible.   An essential book for our times, The Utopia of Rules is sure to start a million conversations about the institutions that rule over us--and the better, freer world we should, perhaps, begin to imagine for ourselves.From the Hardcover edition.||1 online resource||302.350|ebook - ebook|02/24/2015|2015-02-24|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781612193755?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HFtABAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Avi Shlaim.|Three Worlds|Shlaim, Avi|Shlaim, Avi.|Avi Shlaim|Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., Judaica., Multi-Cultural., Electronic books.|Biography & Autobiography|In July 1950, Avi Shlaim, only five, and his family were forced into exile, fleeing from their beloved Iraq into the new state of Israel.    Now the rump of a once flourishing community of over 150,000, dating back 2,600 years, has dwindled to single figures. For many, this tells the story of the timeless clash of the Arab and Jewish civilisations, the heroic mission of Zionism to rescue Eastern Jews from their backwards nations, and unceasing persecution as the fate and history of Jewish people.   Avi Shlaim tears up this script. His mother had many Muslim friends in Baghdad, but no Zionist ones. The Iraqi Jewish community, once celebrated for its ancient heritage and rich culture, was sprayed with DDT upon arrival in Israel. As anti-Semitism gathered pace in Iraq, the Zionist underground may have inflamed it – deliberately.   This memoir celebrates the disappearing heritage of Arab-Jews – caught in the crossfire of secular ideologies.|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|06/08/2023|2023-06-08|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780861544646?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XTWUEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

He was the architect of a new, republican China, a hero of the Second World War, and a faithful ally of the United States. Simultaneously a Christian and a Confucian, Chiang dreamed of universal equality yet was a perfidious and cunning dictator responsible for the deaths of over 1.5 million innocent people.    This critical biography is based on Chiang Kai-shek's unpublished diaries, his extensive personal files from the Russian archives, and the Russian files of his relatives, associates, and foes. Alexander V. Pantsov sheds new light on the role played by the Russians in Chiang's rise to power in the 1920s and throughout his political career—and indeed the Russian influence on the Chinese revolutionary movement as a whole—as well as on Chiang's complex relationship with top officials of the United States. It is a detailed portrait of a man who ranks with Stalin, Roosevelt, Hitler, Churchill, and Gandhi as leaders who shaped our world.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|02/01/2023|2023-03-21|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780300271690?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GU6qEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Hamas is a multifaceted liberation organization that rules Gaza and the lives of the two million Palestinians who live there. Demonized as a terrorist group in media and policy debates, it has been subjected to accusations and assumptions that have helped justify extreme military action in the region. In&#xA0; Hamas Contained , Tareq Baconi offers the first history of the group on its own terms.&#xA0;    Drawing on interviews with organization leaders, as well as publications from the group, Baconi maps Hamas's thirty-year transition from fringe resistance to governance. Questioning the conventional understanding of Hamas, he shows how the movement's ideology ultimately threatens the Palestinian struggle and, inadvertently, its own legitimacy.&#xA0;   Baconi demonstrates how Hamas's armed struggle has failed in the face of a relentless occupation, and he argues that Israel's approach of managing rather than resolving the conflict has neutralized Hamas's demand for Palestinian sovereignty. This dynamic has perpetuated a deadlock characterized by its brutality-and one that has led to the collective punishment of millions of Palestinian civilians.|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||324.2569421|ebook - ebook|05/25/2023|2018-05-15|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781503605817?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S7xaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Jean Ritchie.|Kiss of Death|Ritchie, Jean|Ritchie, Jean.|Jean Ritchie|Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., True Crime., Electronic books.|True Crime|Obsession, jealousy, lust, revenge ...  There is nothing more dangerous than a passion that curdles into  murderous intent . Love, when it goes wrong and spirals into violence, can lead to the most  tragically chilling  consequences; death at the hands of a partner or ex-partner is the most common way for a woman to be murdered, far outnumbering her risk of murder by stranger.  Sexual obsession  is the theme that ties all of these tragic stories together. There is the tale of talented landscape artist Jill Cahill, whose husband was not content with battering his wife to a pulp and so went back to finish the job while she lay in her hospital bed. There is the wife whose body was found in the boot of her own car, and whose husband had  framed his girlfriend  for the crime, hoping to get rid of two women from his life. But men don't have a monopoly on murder; there is also the case of Martha Freeman, who hid her lover in her wardrobe, and teamed up with him to  murder her husband .  John Tanner served a twelve-year sentence for the murder of his girlfriend, and is now back behind bars for another attack on another partner. British soldier Emile Cilliers attempted to murder his wife by  cutting the cords of her parachute ; however, while he may not have succeeded, Belgian teacher and amateur skydiver Els Clotterman did when she cut her love rival's cords five years earlier. These, and many others, are the stories of  fatal attraction  you will find in the pages of this book .||1 online resource||364.1523092|ebook - ebook|04/02/2020|2020-04-02|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781789292305?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=41_aDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In The Shortest History of India, John Zubrzycki distils five millennia of gods and kings, conquerors and colonisers into an epic tale teeming with personalities both legendary and largely unknown outside India. Gautama Buddha, Alexander the Great and Mahatma Gandhi share the stage with Candragupta ('India's Julius Caesar'), Nizam Saqqa, the water-carrier who became king for a day, and Raziyya, the first Muslim woman to rule in the subcontinent. The later chapters reveal a modern India riven by contrasts: the brutal reality of partition and the fantasies of Bollywood, booming IT businesses and expanding slums. In conclusion, Zubrzycki asks whether internal challenges - from religious tensions to an increasingly undemocratic regime - might still thwart India's rise to wealth and power.||1 online resource||954|ebook - ebook|03/07/2023|2022|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781913083359?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mqf8zwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Simultaneously a prequel and a continuation of his bestselling The Lamb's Supper, The Fourth Cup not only tracks the author's gradual conversion along the path of Evangelicalism to the doorsteps of the Catholic faith, but also explores the often obscure and misunderstood rituals of Passover and their importance in foreshadowing salvation in Jesus Christ. Revealing the story of his formative years as an often hot-headed student and earnest seeker in search of answers to great biblical mysteries, Hahn shows how his ardent exploration of the Bible's Old Testament turned up intriguing clues connecting the Last Supper and Christ's death on Calvary. As Hahn tells the story of his discovery of the supreme importance of the Passover in God's plan of salvation, we too experience often-overlooked relationships between Abel, Abraham, and the Hebrews' liberation from slavery in Egypt. Along the way, Hahn reveals how the traditional fourth cup of wine used in the concluding celebration of Passover explains in astonishing ways Christ's paschal sacrifice.Rooted in Scripture and ingrained with lively history, The Fourth Cup delivers a fascinating view of the bridges that span old and new covenants, and celebrates the importance of the Jewish faith in understanding more fully Christ's life, death, and resurrection.||1 online resource||232.957|ebook - ebook|02/20/2018|2018-02-20|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781524758806?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TjbcDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In The Iron Cage, Rashid Khalidi, one of the most respected historians and political observers of the Middle East, homes in on Palestinian politics and history. By drawing on a wealth of experience and scholarship, Khalidi provides a lucid context for the realities on the ground today, a context that has been, until now, notably lacking in our discourse.The story of the Palestinian search to establish a state begins in the mandate period immediately following the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, the era of British control, when fledgling Arab states were established by the colonial powers with assurances of eventual independence. Mandatory Palestine was a place of real promise, with unusually high literacy rates and a relatively advanced economy.

Like other immigrant groups before them, they showed up with little money but with an intense work ethic and an unshakeable belief in the promise of the United States.  Many of them lived in a world outside the law, working in a shadow economy overseen by the ruthless gangs that ruled the narrow streets of New York's Chinatown.The figure who came to dominate this Chinese underworld was a middle-aged grandmother known as Sister Ping.  Her path to the American dream began with an unusual business run out of a tiny noodle store on Hester Street. From her perch above the shop, Sister Ping ran a full-service underground bank for illegal Chinese immigrants.

Michael Beckley.|Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict with China|Beckley, Michael|Beckley, Michael.|Michael Beckley, Hal Brands|Nonfiction., Politics., Electronic books.|Political Science|A provocative and urgent analysis of the U.S.-China rivalry.    It has become conventional wisdom that America and China are running a superpower marathon that may last a century. Yet Hal Brands and Michael Beckley pose a counterintuitive question: What if the sharpest phase of that competition is more like a decade-long sprint?   The Sino-American contest is driven by clashing geopolitical interests and a stark ideological dispute over whether authoritarianism or democracy will dominate the 21st century. But both history and China's current trajectory suggest that this rivalry will reach its moment of maximum danger in the 2020s.   China is at a perilous moment: strong enough to violently challenge the existing order, yet losing confidence that time is on its side. Numerous examples from antiquity to the present show that rising powers become most aggressive when their fortunes fade, their difficulties multiply, and they realize they must achieve their ambitions now or miss the chance to do so forever. China has already started down this path. Witness its aggression toward Taiwan, its record-breaking military buildup, and its efforts to dominate the critical technologies that will shape the world's future.   Over the long run, the Chinese challenge will most likely prove more manageable than many pessimists currently believe-but during the 2020s, the pace of Sino-American conflict will accelerate, and the prospect of war will be frighteningly real. America, Brands and Beckley argue, will still need a sustainable approach to winning a protracted global competition. But first, it needs a near-term strategy for navigating the danger zone ahead.||1 online resource||327.73051|ebook - ebook|08/16/2022|2022-08-16|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781324021315?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H_ZhEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Gregory Makoff.|Default|Makoff, Gregory|Makoff, Gregory.|Gregory Makoff|Nonfiction., Business., Law., Politics., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|The dramatic inside story of the most important case in the history of sovereign debt law   Unlike individuals or corporations that become insolvent, nations do not have access to bankruptcy protection from their creditors. When a country defaults on its debt, the international financial system is ill equipped to manage the crisis. Decisions by key individuals—from national leaders to those at the International Monetary Fund, from holdout creditors to judges—determine the fate of an entire national economy. A prime example is Argentina's 2001 default on $100 billion in bonds, which stands out for its messy outcomes and outsized impact on sovereign debt markets, sovereign debt law, and IMF policy.   Default  is the riveting story of Argentina's sovereign debt drama, which reveals the obscure inner workings of sovereign debt restructuring. This detailed case study describes the intense fight over the role of the IMF in Argentina's 2005 debt restructuring and the ensuing bitter decade of litigation with holdout creditors, demonstrating that outcomes for sovereign debt are determined by a complex interplay between financial markets, governments, the IMF, the press, and the courts.   This cautionary tale lays bare the institutional, political, and legal pressures that come into play when a country cannot repay its debts. It offers a deeper understanding of how global financial capitalism functions for those who work in or study debt markets, international finance, international relations, and international law.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|02/01/2024|2024-02-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781647123987?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dpq7EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Too much tactical information. He's very open about these things in his press conferences too. Other coaches don't do that. Any coach who reads your book will get a complete run down of Pep's tactics . . .' For three extraordinary seasons, Martí Perarnau was given total access around Bayern Munich - to its players, its backroom staff, its board members and, above all, to its manager, Pep Guardiola. In the follow-up to his critically acclaimed account of Guardiola's first full season at Bayern, Pep Confidential, Perarnau now lifts the lid on the Catalan's whole tenure in Bavaria. Pep Guardiola: The Evolution takes the reader on a journey through three action packed seasons as Bayern smashed domestic records yet struggled to emulate that dominance in Europe, analysing Guardiola's management style through key moments on and off the field. As the author shadows the manager and his superstar players during training and matchdays, he delivers a portrait of some of football's most spellbinding individuals that is as enthralling as it is utterly unique. Perarnau reveals how Guardiola improved as a manager at Bayern despite failing to land the ultimate prize in European football, examines his decision to leave Germany to take up the challenge at Manchester City and how his managerial style will continue to evolve in the Premier League.This is more than the story of three seasons with one of the biggest clubs in the game, it is a portrait and analysis of a manager and the footballing philosophies that have beguiled the world.||1 online resource||796.334092|ebook - ebook|11/04/2016|2016-11-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780857909220?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d3DtDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Precariously positioned between China and India, Burma's population has suffered dictatorship, natural disaster, and the dark legacies of colonial rule. But when decades of military dictatorship finally ended and internationally beloved Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi emerged from long years of house arrest, hopes soared. World leaders such as Barack Obama ushered in waves of international support. Progress seemed inevitable.   As historian, former diplomat, and presidential advisor, Thant Myint-U saw the cracks forming. In this insider's diagnosis of a country at a breaking point, he dissects how a singularly predatory economic system, fast-rising inequality, disintegrating state institutions, the impact of new social media, the rise of China next door, climate change, and deep-seated feelings around race, religion, and national identity all came together to challenge the incipient democracy. Interracial violence soared and a horrific exodus of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees fixed international attention. Myint-U explains how and why this happened, and details an unsettling prognosis for the future.   Burma is today a fragile stage for nearly all the world's problems. Are democracy and an economy that genuinely serves all its people possible in Burma? In clear and urgent prose, Myint-U explores this question-a concern not just for the Burmese but for the rest of the world-warning of the possible collapse of this nation of 55 million while suggesting a fresh agenda for change.||1 online resource||959.1053|ebook - ebook|11/12/2019|2019-11-12|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781324003304?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Xv2KDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Johan Norberg.|The Capitalist Manifesto|Norberg, Johan|Norberg, Johan.|Johan Norberg|Nonfiction., Business., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|A vital exploration of capitalism and the benefits it brings to global society. Marx and Engels were right when they observed in The Communist Manifesto that free markets had in a short time created greater prosperity and more technological innovation than all previous generations combined. A century and a half later, all the evidence shows that capitalism has lifted millions from hunger and poverty. Nonetheless, today's story about global capitalism, shared by right-wing and left-wing populists - and by large sections of the political and economic establishment - accepts that prosperity has been created, but says it ended up in far too few hands. This in turn has made it popular to talk about the global economy as a geopolitical zero-sum game, where we must fight to control new innovations, introduce trade barriers and renationalize supply chains. More generally, capitalism is also accused of fuelling glaring inequality, populist revolts, climate change and China's global conquest. In this incisive and passionate investigation, Johan Norberg instead restates the case for capitalism and the vital role played by the free market in today's uncertain world. Ultimately, he argues that a move away from global capitalism would not only squeeze the growth out of the economy but also deepen an already large social exclusion for the vulnerable - for the world's poor, it would be a killing blow.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|06/15/2023|2023-06-15|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781838957919?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iaCiEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Today, as much of the world succumbs to authoritarianism and democracy is undermined from its heart, Germany stands as a bulwark for decency and stability. Mixing personal journey and anecdote with compelling empirical evidence, this is a searching and entertaining exploration of the country many in the West still love to hate. Raising important questions for our post-Brexit landscape, Kampfner asks why Germany has become a model for others to emulate, while Britain still languishes in wartime nostalgia and fails to tackle contemporary challenges. Part memoir, part history, part travelogue,  Why the Germans Do It Better  is a rich and witty portrait of an eternally fascinating country.||1 online resource||943.0882|ebook - ebook|08/27/2020|2020-08-27|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781786499776?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WkXXDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Ravi Zacharias.||Zacharias, Ravi|Zacharias, Ravi.||Nonfiction., Religion & Spirituality., Electronic books.||In 2006, Ravi Zacharias International Ministries (RZIM) held an open forum at the Fox Theater in Atlanta to address the subject: 'Has Christianity Failed You?'  Tickets were sold for the event and---to the complete surprise of everyone---the event was sold out with a capacity crowd of over 5,000.  People lined up offering to buy tickets from folks in line for higher prices.   Before the event, an RZIM cameraman walked the streets and asked people if they had rejected the faith they held at one time.  One answered that, because of a Christian's rejection of his gay lifestyle he had done just that.  Another answered that she had left her faith because she had fallen into adultery and could never live it down in the church.  Others had their own reasons.  Some said it was just intellectually untenable in an age of reason.  They chose to come to the event to judge if there were adequate answers.   It is estimated that for every one person who writes a letter or attends an event, there are one thousand who agree.  If the Atlanta crowd was any indication, the question is real and troubling. Why is it that many live with silent doubt, many leaving the 'evangelical fold' for something else?  Is there something wrong with the message, the communicator, the hearer...or is it all three?   It's time to ask the hard questions of what it means to be a follower of Jesus Christ and why it seems as though God has made it so hard to continue believing.  In fact, the son of a prominent U.S. Senator phoned me with that very question.  'Why has God made it so hard to believe in Him?'  Such skepticism is not just representative of the hostile; it also represents many honest questioners.   This book attempts to lay out the response to those within as well as those outside the Christian faith so as to understand what it is we believe and why it is so hard to do so.  More to the point:  Why it is actually so hard to deny God and still make sense out of life?  In the end the answers should be both felt and real, with the added truth that God is nearer than you think.  He desires that we sense Him very near to us and not distant.  But closeness comes at a cost just as any relationship of love and commitment does.||1 online resource||239.7|ebook - ebook|07/06/2010||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780310562443?s=MD|

Examining seven turning points in financial historyâ��from the depression of the 1840s through the Great Depression of the 1930s to the Covid-19 crisisâ��James shows how crashes prompted by a lack of supply, like the oil shortages of the 1970s, lead to greater globalization as markets expand and producers innovate to increase supply. By contrast, crises triggered by a lack of demandâ��such as the Global Financial Crisis of 2007â��2008â��result in less globalization as markets contract, austerity measures are imposed, and skepticism of government grows.  Â   By considering not only the times but also the observers who shaped our understanding of each crisisâ��from Karl Marx to John Maynard Keynes to Larry Summersâ��James shows how the uneven course of globalization has led to new economic thinking, and how understanding this history can help us better prepare for the future.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|05/01/2023|2023-05-16|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780300271492?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Db22EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Martin Jacques.|When China Rules The World|Jacques, Martin|Jacques, Martin.|Martin Jacques|Nonfiction., History., Electronic books., Electronic book|History|China will replace the United States as the world's dominant power. In so doing, it will not become more western but the world will become more Chinese.   Jacques argues that we cannot understand China in western terms but only through its own history and culture. To this end, he introduces a powerful set of ideas including China as a civilization-state, the tributary system, the Chinese idea of race, a very different concept of the state, and the principle of contested modernity.   First published in 2009 to widespread critical acclaim - and controversy - 'When China Rules the World: The End of the Western World and the Rise of a New Global Order' has sold a quarter of a million copies, been translated into eleven languages, nominated for two major literary awards, and has been the subject of an immensely popular TED talk. In the three years since the first edition was published, the book has transformed the debate about China worldwide and proved remarkably prescient.In this greatly expanded and fully updated paperback edition, with nearly three-hundred pages of new material backed up by the latest statistical data, Martin Jacques renews his assault on conventional thinking about China's ascendancy, showing how its impact will be as much political and cultural as economic, thereby transforming the world as we know it.  Martin Jacques is one of Britain's foremost public intellectuals. A Visiting Senior Research Fellow at IDEAS, the London School of Economics' centre for diplomacy and grand strategy, a Visiting Professor at Tsinghua University, Beijing, and a Fellow of the Transatlantic Academy, Washington DC, Martin Jacques is widely respected as a leading global expert on what could prove to be the most important geopolitical event of the past 200 years: the rise of China. He was editor of Marxism Today from 1977 until the journal's closure in 1991, and has also worked as deputy editor of The Independent. He has been a columnist for the Times, the Guardian, the Observer, and the New Statesman, as well as writing for international publications such as the Financial Times, Economist, New York Times, International Herald Tribune, Daily Beast, Volkskrant, Corriere della Sera, L'Unita, South China Morning Post, and Folha Des Paulo.||1 online resource||327.510|ebook - ebook|03/29/2012|2012-03-29|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780241956939?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6Dw2yM9KYvMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In improving your position on the board the old strategy principles often lead to conflicting conclusions. Suba takes another view on the meaning of, for example, ?bad positions? and ?quiet moves?, and uses a light touch to explain his ideas. With many entertaining and instructive examples the author explores ?the accumulation of potential? as the modern way to get the advantage.

Ilyon Woo.|Master Slave Husband Wife|Woo, Ilyon|Woo, Ilyon.|Ilyon Woo|Nonfiction., History., Sociology., Electronic books.|History|A  NEW YORK TIMES  BOOK OF THE YEAR      A  New York Times  bestseller, the incredible true story of a couple that escaped slavery in the South and eventually made their way to the UK, Africa and beyond.  The remarkable true story of Ellen and William Craft, who escaped slavery through daring, determination, and disguise, with Ellen passing as a wealthy, disabled White man and William posing as his slave. In 1848, a year of international democratic revolt, a young, enslaved couple, Ellen and William Craft, achieved one of the boldest feats of self-emancipation in history. Posing as master and slave, while sustained by their love as husband and wife, they made their escape together across more than 1,000 miles, riding steamboats, carriages, and trains that took them from bondage in Georgia to the free states of the North. Along the way, they dodged slave traders, military officers, and even friends of their enslavers, who might have revealed their true identities. The tale of their adventure soon made them celebrities, and generated headlines around the country. Audiences could not get enough of this charismatic young couple, who travelled the country drawing thunderous applause as they spoke alongside some of the greatest abolitionists of the day. But even then, they were not out of danger. With the passage of an infamous new Fugitive Slave Act in 1850, all Americans became accountable for returning refugees like the Crafts to slavery. Then yet another adventure began, as the Crafts fled to England to embark upon a new life. With three epic journeys compressed into one monumental bid for freedom,  Master Slave Husband Wife  recounts both a ground-breaking quest for liberty and justice, and an unforgettable love story.|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|05/11/2023|2023-05-11|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781804183625?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bPK9EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Jonathan Freedland.|The Escape Artist|Freedland, Jonathan|Freedland, Jonathan.|Jonathan Freedland|Nonfiction., History., Electronic books.|History|A brilliant and heart-wrenching book, with universal and timely lessons about the power of information  -  and misinformation. Is it possible to stop mass murder by telling the truth?  -  Yuval Noah Harari, bestselling author of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind and Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow    A complex hero.     A forgotten story.     The first witness to reveal the full truth of the Holocaust . . .     Award-winning journalist and bestselling novelist Jonathan Freedland tells the incredible story of Rudolf Vrba-the first Jew to break out of Auschwitz, a man determined to warn the world and pass on a truth too few were willing to hear-elevating him to his rightful place in the annals of World War II alongside Anne Frank, Primo Levi, and Oskar Schindler and casting a new light on the Holocaust and its aftermath.   People won't believe what they can't imagine . . .   In April 1944, Rudolf Vrba became the first Jew to break out of Auschwitz-one of only four who ever pulled off that near-impossible feat. He did it to reveal the truth of the death camp to the world-and to warn the last Jews of Europe what fate awaited them at the end of the railway line. Against all odds, he and his fellow escapee, Fred Wetzler, climbed mountains, crossed rivers and narrowly missed German bullets until they had smuggled out the first full account of Auschwitz the world had ever seen-a forensically detailed report that would eventually reach Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and the Pope.   And yet too few heeded the warning that Vrba-then just nineteen years old-had risked everything to deliver. Some could not believe it. Others thought it easier to keep quiet. Vrba helped save 200,000 Jewish lives-but he never stopped believing it could have been so many more.   This is the story of a brilliant yet troubled man-a gifted escape artist who even as a teenager understand that the difference between truth and lies can be the difference between life and death, a man who deserves to take his place alongside Anne Frank, Oskar Schindler and Primo Levi as one of the handful of individuals whose stories define our understanding of the Holocaust.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|10/18/2022|2022-10-18|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780063112377?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IElZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Like it or not, we live in a global era, in which what happens thousands of miles away has the ability to affect our lives. This time, it is a Coronavirus known as Covid-19, which originated in a Chinese city many had never heard of but has spread to the corners of the earth. Next time it could well be another infectious disease from somewhere else. Twenty years ago it was a group of terrorists trained in Afghanistan and armed with box-cutters who commandeered four airplanes and flew them into buildings (and in one case a field) and claimed nearly three thousand lives. Next time it could be terrorists who use a truck bomb or gain access to a weapon of mass destruction. In 2016 hackers in a nondescript office building in Russia traveled virtually in cyberspace to manipulate America's elections. Now they have burrowed into our political life. In recent years, severe hurricanes and large fires linked to climate change have ravaged parts of the earth; in the future we can anticipate even more serious natural disasters. In 2008, it was a global financial crisis caused by mortgage-backed securities in America, but one day it could well be a financial contagion originating in Europe, Asia, or Africa. This is the new normal of the 21st century.  The World  is designed to provide readers of any age and experience with the essential background and building blocks they need to make sense of this complicated and interconnected world. It will empower them to manage the flood of daily news. Readers will become more informed, discerning citizens, better able to arrive at sound, independent judgments. While it is impossible to predict what the next crisis will be or where it will originate, those who read  The World  will have what they need to understand its basics and the principal choices for how to respond. In short, this book will make readers more globally literate and put them in a position to make sense of this era. Global literacy-knowing how the world works-is a must, as what goes on outside a country matters enormously to what happens inside. Although the United States is bordered by two oceans, those oceans are not moats. And the so-called Vegas rule-what happens there stays there-does not apply in today's world to anyone anywhere. U.S. foreign policy is uniquely American, but the world Americans seek to shape is not. Globalization can be both good and bad, but it is not something that individuals or countries can opt out of. Even if we want to ignore the world, it will not ignore us. The choice we face is how to respond. We are connected to this world in all sorts of ways. We need to better understand it, both its promise and its threats, in order to make informed choices, be it as students, citizens, voters, parents, employees, or investors. To help readers do just that,  The World  focuses on essential history, what makes each region of the world tick, the many challenges globalization presents, and the most influential countries, events, and ideas. Explaining complex ideas with wisdom and clarity, Richard Haass's  The World  is an evergreen book that will remain relevant and useful as history continues to unfold.||1 online resource||327.090|ebook - ebook|05/12/2020|2020-05-12|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780399562402?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9oisDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

We remember him as a bulldog-squat frame, bulging wide-set eyes, fearsome jowls-but in 1924, when he became director of the FBI, he had been the trim, dazzling wunderkind of the administrative state, buzzing with energy and big ideas for reform. He transformed a failing law-enforcement backwater, riddled with scandal, into a modern machine. He believed in the power of the federal government to do great things for the nation and its citizens. He also believed that certain people-many of them communists or racial minorities or both- did not deserve to be included in that American project. Hoover rose to power and then stayed there, decade after decade, using the tools of state to create a personal fiefdom unrivaled in U.S. history.   Beverly Gage's monumental work  explores the full sweep of Hoover's life and career, from his birth in 1895 to a modest Washington civil-service family through his death in 1972. In her  nuanced and definitive portrait, Gage shows how Hoover was more than a one-dimensional tyrant and schemer who strong-armed the rest of the country into submission. As FBI director from 1924 through his death in 1972, he was a confidant, counselor, and adversary to eight U.S. presidents, four Republicans and four Democrats.  Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson did the most to empower   him, yet his closest friend among the eight was fellow anticommunist warrior Richard Nixon.  Hoover was not above blackmail and intimidation, but he also embodied conservative values ranging from anticommunism to white supremacy to a crusading and politicized interpretation of Christianity. This garnered him the admiration of millions of Americans. He stayed in office for so long because many people, from the highest reaches of government down to the grassroots, wanted him there and supported what he was doing, thus creating the template that the political right has followed to transform its party.  G-Man  places Hoover back where he once stood in American political history-not at the fringes, but at the center-and uses his story to explain the trajectories of governance, policing, race, ideology, political culture, and federal power as they evolved over the course of the 20th century."||1 online resource||363.25092|ebook - ebook|11/22/2022|2022-11-22|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593492611?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SOdaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Continental football has always cast a spell over the imagination. From the attacking flair of Real Madrid of the 50s to the defensive brilliance of the Italians in the 60s and onto the total football of the Dutch in the 70s, the European leagues have been where the game has most evolved and taken its biggest steps forward. And over the last three decades, since the rebranding of the Champions League in 1992, that pattern has continued unabated, with each major European footballing nation playing its part in how the game's tactics have developed. From the intelligent use of space displayed by the phenomenal Ajax team of the early 90s, to the dominance of the highly strategic Italian league in the late 90s and onto the technical wizardry of Barcelona's tiki-taka, the European game continues to reinvent the tactical dimension of the game, creating blueprints which both club and national teams around the world strive to follow. In Zonal Marking, Michael Cox brilliantly investigates and analyses the major leagues around Europe over specific time periods and demonstrates the impact each has made on how the game is now played. Highly entertaining and packed full of wonderful anecdotes, this is the first book of its kind to take an overview of modern European football, and lays bare just how much the international language of football can be shaped by a nation's unique identity.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|05/30/2019|2019-05-30|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008291150?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jrx6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Also covered is the story of Kane's formative years at Chingford Foundation School, his rejection by Spurs' great North London rivals Arsenal and loan spells with the likes of Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich City and Leicester City prior to his emergence as leading light for club and country and a major contender for the 2018 Ballon d'Or.

Jonathan Clegg.|Messi vs. Ronaldo|Clegg, Jonathan|Clegg, Jonathan.|Jonathan Clegg, Joshua Robinson|Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., Sports & Recreations., Electronic books.|Sports & Recreation|Wall Street Journal reporters Joshua Robinson and Jonathan Clegg offer a deeply reported account of the intertwined sagas and legacies of two of the greatest soccer players of all time-Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo-examining how their rivalry has grown from a personal competition to a multi-billion-dollar industry, paralleling the stunning rise, overwhelming excesses, and uncertain future of modern international soccer.  For over fifteen years, almost any conversation about international soccer has always come back to two players-Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo-undoubtedly the greatest of their generation but with styles, attitudes, and fanbases that couldn't be more different. For millions of people around the world Messi or Ronaldo? isn't simply a barroom argument, or an affirmation of fandom, so much as a statement of philosophy, of values, of what global soccer is today and of what it will be tomorrow.  Now Wall Street Journal reporters and co-authors of The Club, Joshua Robinson and Jonathan Clegg, unite the stories of Messi and Ronaldo into a single modern epic of global sports, detailing how one rivalry changed both the game and the business of international soccer-forever. Based on dozens of firsthand accounts and years of original reporting, Messi vs. Ronaldo weaves together the stakes, color, and characters at the heart of each man's story, going inside the locker rooms and boardrooms where their legends were forged and revealing off-field drama as gripping as anything that happened on it. From their contrasting origin stories to their divergent career arcs and their conflicting reputations, these players have built their successes on opposite paths, yet each, in his own way, offers a riveting tale of triumph and excess. Taken together, their story embodies the astronomical growth of international soccer, how social media has revolutionized the power of sports celebrity, and how the desire to capitalize on the billions of dollars these players represent electrified some of the most storied clubs in Europe-Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Manchester United among them-and cost them almost everything.  With the 2022 World Cup almost certain to be the last for both of these figures, Messi vs. Ronaldo offers a deeply researched look at their legacy and grapples with the impact that their talents have had on the game for better and for worse. Much more than a retelling of the dual accomplishments of these great players, this is truly a biography of a rivalry, one that has become a crucial lens for understanding the past, present, and future of global soccer.||1 online resource||796.334092|ebook - ebook|11/01/2022|2022-11-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780063157224?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9jxdEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Its origins, and that of the wider Arab-Israeli conflict, are deeply rooted in Jewish-Arab confrontation and appropriation in Palestine. But the isolated occasions of violence during the British Mandate era (1920-48) suggest that the majority of Palestinian Arabs yearned to live and thrive under peaceful coexistence with the evolving Jewish national enterprise. So what was the real cause of the breakdown in relations between the two communities?In this brave and groundbreaking book, Efraim Karsh tells the story from both the Arab and Jewish perspectives. He argues that from the early 1920s onward, a corrupt and extremist leadership worked toward eliminating the Jewish national revival and protecting its own interests. Karsh has mined many of the Western, Soviet, UN, and Israeli documents declassified over the past decade, as well as unfamiliar Arab sources, to reveal what happened behind the scenes on both Palestinian and Jewish sides. It is an arresting story of delicate political and diplomatic maneuvering by leading figures-Ben Gurion, Hajj Amin Husseini, Abdel Rahman Azzam, King Abdullah, Bevin, and Truman -over the years leading up to partition, through the slide to war and its enduring consequences.

But after two years of occupation, the Afghan people rose in answer to the call for jihad and the country exploded into violent rebellion.

The Russo-Ukrainian War is the most serious geopolitical crisis since the Second World War - and yet at the heart of the conflict is a mystery. Vladimir Putin apparently lurched from a calculating, subtle master of opportunity to a reckless gambler, putting his regime - and Russia itself - at risk of destruction. Why? Drawing on over 25 years' experience as a correspondent in Moscow, as well as his own family ties to Russia and Ukraine, journalist Owen Matthews takes us through the poisoned historical roots of the conflict, into the Covid bubble where Putin conceived his invasion plans in a fog of paranoia about Western threats, and finally into the inner circle around Ukrainian president and unexpected war hero Volodimir Zelensky. Using the accounts of current and former insiders from the Kremlin and its propaganda machine, the testimony of captured Russian soldiers and on-the-ground reporting from Russia and Ukraine, Overreach tells the story not only of the war's causes but how the first six months unfolded. With its panoramic view, Overreach is an authoritative, unmissable record of a conflict that shocked Europe to its core.||1 online resource||947.7086|ebook - ebook|11/10/2022|2022-11-10|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008562755?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UPp8EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Amitav Ghosh.|Smoke and Ashes|Ghosh, Amitav|Ghosh, Amitav.|Amitav Ghosh|Nonfiction., History., Electronic books.|History|Named a Most Anticipated Book of 2024 by  Foreign Policy ,  Literary Hub , and  The Millions    Ghosh unravels the impact of the opium trade on global history and in his own family―the climax of a yearslong project.   When Amitav Ghosh began the research for his monumental cycle of novels the Ibis Trilogy, he was startled to learn how the lives of the nineteenth-century sailors and soldiers he wrote about were dictated not only by the currents of the Indian Ocean but also by the precious commodity carried in enormous quantities on those currents: opium. Most surprising of all, however, was the discovery that his own identity and family history were swept up in the story.   Smoke and Ashes  is at once a travelogue, a memoir, and an essay in history, drawing on decades of archival research. In it, Ghosh traces the transformative effect the opium trade had on Britain, India, and China, as well as the world at large. The trade was engineered by the British Empire, which exported Indian opium to sell to China to redress their great trade imbalance, and its revenues were essential to the empire's financial survival. Following the profits further, Ghosh finds opium central to the origins of some of the world's biggest corporations, of America's most powerful families and prestigious institutions (from the Astors and Coolidges to the Ivy League), and of contemporary globalism itself.  Moving deftly between horticultural history, the mythologies of capitalism, and the social and cultural repercussions of colonialism, in  Smoke and Ashes  Ghosh reveals the role that one small plant has had in making our world, now teetering on the edge of catastrophe.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|02/13/2024|2024-02-13|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780374711993?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uuW5EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

A new world order, with China and India as the strongest economies, dawns. How will the West react to its new status of superpower in decline?    In Kishore Mahbubani's timely polemic, he argues passionately that the West can no longer presume to impose its ideology on the world, and crucially, that it must stop seeking to intervene, politically and militarily, in the affairs of other nations. He examines the West's greatest follies of recent times: the humiliation of Russia at the end of the Cold War, which led to the rise of Putin, and the invasion of Iraq after 9/11, which destabilised the Middle East. Yet, he argues, essential to future world peace are the Western constructs of democracy and reason, which it must continue to promote, by diplomacy rather than force, via multilateral institutions of global governance such as the UN. Only by recognising its changing status, and seeking to influence rather than dominate, he warns, can the West continue to play a key geopolitical role.  'Kishore Mahbubani might well be the most intelligent, friendly and doggedly persistent critic of the West. In this brief book, he delivers some of his trademark analysis and pungent observations. We should all think of it as the cold shower that is urgently needed to revive the West' Fareed Zakaria, author of  The Post-American World   'A powerful, disputatious book.

Like George Washington and his own hero Julius Caesar, he was one of the greatest soldier-statesmen of all times. Andrew Roberts's Napoleon is the first one-volume biography to take advantage of the recent publication of Napoleon's thirty-three thousand letters, which radically transform our understanding of his character and motivation. At last we see him as he was: protean multitasker, decisive, surprisingly willing to forgive his enemies and his errant wife Josephine. Like Churchill, he understood the strategic importance of telling his own story, and his memoirs, dictated from exile on St. Helena, became the single bestselling book of the nineteenth century. An award-winning historian, Roberts traveled to fifty-three of Napoleon's sixty battle sites, discovered crucial new documents in archives, and even made the long trip by boat to St. Helena. He is as acute in his understanding of politics as he is of military history. Here at last is a biography worthy of its subject: magisterial, insightful, beautifully written, by one of our foremost historians.From the Hardcover edition.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|11/04/2014|2014-11-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780698176287?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rjVBAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Yet Kissinger was also reviled by large segments of the American public, ranging from liberal intellectuals to conservative activists. Kissinger explores the relationship between this complex man's personality and the foreign policy he pursued. Drawing on extensive interviews with Kissinger as well as 150 other sources, including U.S. presidents and his business clients, this first full-length biography makes use of many of Kissinger's private papers and classified memos to tell his uniquely American story. The result is an intimate narrative, filled with surprising revelations, that takes this grandly colorful statesman from his childhood as a persecuted Jew in Nazi Germany, through his tortured relationship with Richard Nixon, to his later years as a globe-trotting business consultant.||1 online resource||973.924092|ebook - ebook|05/21/2013||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781439127216?s=MD|

Bass.||Bass, Gary J.|Bass, Gary Jonathan||Nonfiction., History., Electronic books.||NAMED A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR BY  THE NEW YORKER • THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW  EDITORS’ CHOICE •   A landmark, magisterial history of the trial of Japan’s leaders as war criminals—the largely overlooked Asian counterpart to Nuremberg “Nothing less than a masterpiece. With epic research and mesmerizing narrative power,  Judgment at Tokyo  has the makings of an instant classic.” —Evan Osnos, National Book Award–winning author of  Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China   In the weeks after Japan finally surrendered to the Allies to end World War II, the world turned to the question of how to move on from years of carnage and destruction. For Harry Truman, Douglas MacArthur, Chiang Kai-shek, and their fellow victors, the question of justice seemed clear: Japan’s militaristic leaders needed to be tried and punished for the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor; shocking atrocities against civilians in China, the Philippines, and elsewhere; and rampant abuses of prisoners of war in notorious incidents such as the Bataan death march. For the Allied powers, the trial was an opportunity to render judgment on their vanquished foes, but also to create a legal framework to prosecute war crimes and prohibit the use of aggressive war, building a more peaceful world under international law and American hegemony. For the Japanese leaders on trial, it was their chance to argue that their war had been waged to liberate Asia from Western imperialism and that the court was victors’ justice. For more than two years, lawyers for both sides presented their cases before a panel of clashing judges from China, India, the Philippines, and Australia, as well as the United States and European powers. The testimony ran from horrific accounts of brutality and the secret plans to attack Pearl Harbor to the Japanese military’s threats to subvert the government if it sued for peace. Yet rather than clarity and unanimity, the trial brought complexity, dissents, and divisions that provoke international discord between China, Japan, and Korea to this day. Those courtroom tensions and contradictions could also be seen playing out across Asia as the trial unfolded in the crucial early years of the Cold War, from China’s descent into civil war to Japan’s successful postwar democratic elections to India’s independence and partition. From the author of the acclaimed  The Blood Telegram,  which was a Pulitzer Prize finalist, this magnificent history is the product of a decade of research and writing.  Judgment at Tokyo  is a riveting story of wartime action, dramatic courtroom battles, and the epic formative years that set the stage for the Asian postwar era.||1 online resource||341.690268|ebook - ebook|10/17/2023||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781101947111?s=MD|

John C Lennox.|Seven Days that Divide the World, 10th Anniversary Edition|Lennox, John C.|Lennox, John C.|John C. Lennox|Nonfiction., Christian Nonfiction., Religion & Spirituality., Science., Electronic books.|Religion|Now revised and updated-John Lennox's acclaimed method of reading and interpreting the first chapters of Genesis without discounting either science or Scripture.    What did the writer of Genesis mean by the first day? Are the seven days in Genesis 1 a literal week or a series of time periods? If I believe that the earth is 4.5 billion years old as cosmologists believe, am I denying the authority of Scripture?  With examples from history, a brief but thorough exploration of the major interpretations, and a look into the particular significance of the creation of human beings, Lennox suggests that Christians can heed modern scientific knowledge while staying faithful to the biblical narrative. He moves beyond a simple response to the controversy, insisting that Genesis teaches us far more about the God of Jesus Christ and about God's intention for creation than it does about the age of the earth.  With this book, Lennox offers a careful and accessible introduction to a scientifically-savvy, theologically-astute, and Scripturally faithful interpretation of Genesis.  Since its publication in 2011, this book has enabled many readers to see that the major controversy with which it engages can be resolved without compromising commitment to the authority of Scripture. In this newly revised and expanded edition, John clarifies his arguments, responds to comments and critiques of the past decade since its first publication. In particular, he describes some of the history up to modern times of Jewish scholarly interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative as well as spelling out in more detail the breadth of views in the Great Tradition of interpretation due to the early Church Fathers. He shows that, contrary to what many people think, much of the difficulty with understanding the biblical texts does not arise from modern science but from attempting to elucidate the texts in their own right.||1 online resource||231.7652|ebook - ebook|10/12/2021|2021-10-12|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780310127826?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tQIlEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

I cannot even begin to convey the clarity, the intensity, the power, the photographic storytelling of  They Called Me a Lioness .-Ibram X. Kendi, internationally bestselling author of  How to Be an Antiracist    What would you do if you grew up seeing your home repeatedly raided? Your parents arrested? Your mother shot? Your uncle killed? Try, for just a moment, to imagine that this was your life. How would you want the world to react?  Ahed Tamimi is a world-renowned Palestinian activist, born and raised in the small West Bank village of Nabi Saleh, which became a center of the resistance to Israeli occupation when an illegal, Jewish-only settlement blocked off its community spring. Tamimi came of age participating in nonviolent demonstrations against this action and the occupation at large. Her global renown reached an apex in December 2017, when, at sixteen years old, she was filmed slapping an Israeli soldier who refused to leave her front yard. The video went viral, and Tamimi was arrested. But this is not just a story of activism or imprisonment. It is the human-scale story of an occupation that has riveted the world and shaped global politics, from a girl who grew up in the middle of it . Tamimi's father was born in 1967, the year that Israel began its occupation of the West Bank and he grew up immersed in the resistance movement. One of Tamimi's earliest memories is visiting him in prison, poking her toddler fingers through the fence to touch his hand. She herself would spend her seventeenth birthday behind bars. Living through this greatest test and heightened attacks on her village, Tamimi felt her resolve only deepen, in tension with her attempts to live the normal life of a daughter, sibling, friend, and student. An essential addition to an important conversation,  They Called Me a Lioness  shows us what is at stake in this struggle and offers a fresh vision for resistance. With their unflinching, riveting storytelling, Ahed Tamimi and Dena Takruri shine a light on the humanity not just in occupied Palestine but also in the unsung lives of people struggling for freedom around the world.||1 online resource||956.942092|ebook - ebook|09/06/2022|2022-09-06|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593134603?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BVFTEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Starting with the earliest references in Egyptian and Assyrian texts, Nur Masalha explores how Palestine and its Palestinian identity have evolved over thousands of years, from the Bronze Age to the present day. Drawing on a rich body of sources and the latest archaeological evidence, Masalha shows how Palestine's multicultural past has been distorted and mythologised by Biblical lore and the Israel-Palestinian conflict. In the process, Masalha reveals that the concept of Palestine, contrary to accepted belief, is not a modern invention or one constructed in opposition to Israel, but rooted firmly in ancient past.  Palestine  represents the authoritative account of the country's history.||1 online resource||956.94|ebook - ebook|08/15/2018|2018-08-15|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781786992758?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Cb2rDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

A truthful look at today's most divisive issues'  -   Jordan B. Peterson      '[Murray's] latest book is beyond brilliant and should be read, must be read, by everyone'  -  Richard Dawkins     In his devastating new book  The Madness of Crowds , Douglas Murray examines the twenty-first century's most divisive issues: sexuality, gender, technology and race. He reveals the astonishing new culture wars playing out in our workplaces, universities, schools and homes in the names of social justice, identity politics and 'intersectionality'. We are living through a postmodern era in which the grand narratives of religion and political ideology have collapsed. In their place have emerged a crusading desire to right perceived wrongs and a weaponization of identity, both accelerated by the new forms of social and news media. Narrow sets of interests now dominate the agenda as society becomes more and more tribal - and, as Murray shows, the casualties are mounting.  Readers of all political persuasions cannot afford to ignore Murray's masterfully argued and fiercely provocative book, in which he seeks to inject some sense into the discussion around this generation's most complicated issues. He ends with an impassioned call for free speech, shared common values and sanity in an age of mass hysteria.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|09/17/2019|2019-09-17|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781472959942?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tPyaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

After Mao conquered China in 1949, his secret goal was to dominate the world. In chasing this dream he caused the deaths of 38 million people in the greatest famine in history. In all, well over 70 million Chinese perished under Mao's rule -- in peacetime.|Title from eBook information screen.|||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|10/05/2011|2011-10-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780307807137?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-WZ3j4USEzgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

This conflict between the world's two most powerful nations wouldn't have happened were it not for an unnecessary clash of false narratives. America falsely blames its trade and technology threats on China yet overlooks its shaky saving foundation. China falsely blames its growth challenges on America's alleged containment of market-based socialism, ignoring its failed economic rebalancing.    In a hard-hitting analysis of both nations' economies, politics, and policies, Stephen Roach argues that much of the rhetoric on both sides is dangerously misguided, amplified by information distortion, and more a reflection of each nation's fears and vulnerabilities than a credible assessment of the risks they face. Outlining the disastrous toll of conflict escalation between China and America, Roach offers a new road map to restoring a mutually advantageous relationship.||1 online resource||327.73051|ebook - ebook|11/01/2022|2022-11-08|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780300269017?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gMOHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

But on his way to the Big Leagues, Ron stumbled, his  dreams broken by drinking, drugs, and women. Then, on a winter night in  1982, not far from Ron's home, a young cocktail waitress named Debra Sue  Carter was savagely murdered. The investigation led nowhere. Until, on  the flimsiest evidence, it led to Ron Williamson. The washed-up  small-town hero was charged, tried, and sentenced to death--in a trial  littered with lying witnesses and tainted evidence that would shatter a  man's already broken life, and let a true killer go free.Impeccably  researched, grippingly told, filled with eleventh-hour drama, John  Grisham's first work of nonfiction reads like a page-turning legal  thriller.

Jill Duggar and her husband Derick are finally ready to share their story, revealing the secrets, manipulation, and intimidation behind the show that remained hidden from their fans.  Jill and Derick knew a normal life wasn't possible for them. As a star on the popular TLC reality show  19 Kids and Counting , Jill grew up in front of viewers who were fascinated by her family's way of life. She was the responsible, second daughter of Jim Bob and Michelle's nineteen kids; always with a baby on her hip and happy to wear the modest ankle-length dresses with throat-high necklines. She didn't protest the strict model of patriarchy that her family followed, which declares that men are superior, that women are expected to be wives and mothers and are discouraged from attaining a higher education, and that parental authority over their children continues well into adulthood, even once they are married. But as Jill got older, married Derick, and they embarked on their own lives, the red flags became too obvious to ignore. For as long as they could, Jill and Derick tried to be obedient family members-they weren't willing to rock the boat. But now they're raising a family of their own, and they're done with the secrets. Thanks to time, tears, therapy, and blessings from God, they have the strength to share their journey. Theirs is a remarkable story of the power of the truth and is a moving example of how to find healing through honesty.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|09/12/2023|2023-09-12|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781668024461?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TlvBEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Even as divorce proceedings and allegations of misconduct have recently tarnished his public image, the beneficence of the Gates Foundation, celebrated for spending billions to save lives around the globe, is taken as a given. But as Tim Schwab shows in this fearless investigation, Gates is still exactly who he was at Microsoft: a bully and monopolist, convinced of his own righteousness and intent on imposing his ideas, his solutions, and his leadership on everyone else. At the core, he is not a selfless philanthropist but a power broker, a clever engineer who has innovated a way to turn extreme wealth into immense political influence—and who has made us believe we should applaud his acquisition of power, not challenge it.  Piercing the blinding halo that has for too long shielded the world's most powerful (and most secretive) charitable organization from public scrutiny,  The Bill Gates Problem  shows how Gates's billions have purchased a stunning level of control over public policy, private markets, scientific research, and the news media. Whether he is pushing new educational standards in America, health reforms in India, global vaccine policy during the pandemic, or Western industrialized agriculture throughout Africa, Gates's heady social experimentation has shown itself to be not only undemocratic, but also ineffective. In many places, Bill Gates is hurting the very people he intends to help.  No less than dark-money campaign contributions or big-business political lobbying, Bill Gates's philanthropic empire needs to be seen as a problem of money in politics. It is a dangerous model of unconstrained power that threatens democracy and demands our attention.||1 online resource||338.7610053|ebook - ebook|11/14/2023|2023-11-14|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781250850089?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DwesEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Why does such a small country speak to so many global concerns? More pressingly: Why does Israel make the decisions it does? And what lies in its future?We cannot answer these questions until we understand Israel's people and the questions and conflicts, the hopes and desires, that have animated their conversations and actions. Though Israel's history is rife with conflict, these conflicts do not fully communicate the spirit of Israel and its people: they give short shrift to the dream that gave birth to the state, and to the vision for the Jewish people that was at its core. Guiding us through the milestones of Israeli history, Gordis relays the drama of the Jewish people's story and the creation of the state. Clear-eyed and erudite, he illustrates how Israel became a cultural, economic and military powerhouse-but also explains where Israel made grave mistakes and traces the long history of Israel's deepening isolation. With Israel, public intellectual Daniel Gordis offers us a brief but thorough account of the cultural, economic, and political history of this complex nation, from its beginnings to the present. Accessible, levelheaded, and rigorous, Israel sheds light on the Israel's past so we can understand its future. The result is a vivid portrait of a people, and a nation, reborn.||1 online resource||956.9405|ebook - ebook|10/26/2016|2016-10-18|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062368768?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cQlyCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Eighty-eight percent of the world's population outside the West is rising to Western living standards, and sharing Western aspirations. Yet Mahbubani, one of the most perceptive global commentators, also warns that a new global order needs new policies and attitudes.  Policymakers all over the world must change their preconceptions and accept that we live in one world. National interests must be balanced with global interests. Power must be shared. The U.S. and Europe must cede some power. China and India, Africa and the Islamic world must be integrated. Mahbubani urges that only through these actions can we create a world that converges benignly.

Twenge|Nonfiction., Sociology., Electronic books.|Social Science|A groundbreaking, revelatory portrait of the six generations that currently live in the United States and how they connect, conflict, and compete with one another—from the acclaimed author of  Generation Me  and  iGen.   The United States is currently home to six generations of people:    -the Silents, born 1925–1945  -Baby Boomers, born 1946–1964  -Gen X, born 1965–1979  -Millennials, born 1980–1994  -Gen Z, born 1995–2012  -and the still-to-be-named cohorts born after 2012.    They have had vastly different life experiences and thus, one assumes, they must have vastly diverging beliefs and behaviors. But what are those differences, what causes them, and how deep do they actually run?    Professor of psychology and reigning expert on generational change (Lisa Wade, PhD, author of  American Hookup ), Jean Twenge does a deep dive into a treasure trove of long-running, government-funded surveys and databases to answer these questions. Are we truly defined by major historical events, such as the Great Depression for the Silents and September 11 for Millennials? Or, as Twenge argues, is it the rapid evolution of technology that differentiates the generations?    With her clear-eyed and insightful voice, Twenge explores what the Silents and Boomers want out of the rest of their lives; how Gen X-ers are facing middle age; the ideals of Millennials as parents and in the workplace; and how Gen Z has been changed by COVID, among other fascinating topics.    Surprising, engaging, and informative,  Generations  will forever change the way you view your parents, peers, coworkers, and children, no matter which generation you call your own.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|04/25/2023|2023-04-25|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781982181635?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zsV0EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Zhou Enlai spent twenty-seven years as premier of the People's Republic of China and ten as its foreign minister. He was the architect of the country's administrative apparatus and its relationship to the world, as well as its legendary spymaster. Richard Nixon proclaimed him the greatest statesman of our era. Yet Zhou has always been overshadowed by Chairman Mao. Chen Jian brings Zhou into the light, offering a nuanced portrait of his complex life as a revolutionary, a master diplomat, and a man with his own vision and aspirations who did much to make China, as well as the larger world, what it is today. Born to a declining mandarin family in 1898, Zhou received a classical education and as a teenager spent time in Japan. As a young man, driven by the desire for China's development, Zhou embraced the communist revolution as a vehicle of China's salvation. He helped Mao govern through a series of transformations, including the disastrous Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution. Yet, as Chen shows, Zhou was never a committed Maoist. His extraordinary political and bureaucratic skill, combined with his centrist approaches, enabled him to mitigate the enormous damage caused by Mao's radicalism. When Zhou died in 1976, the PRC that we know of was not yet visible on the horizon; he never saw glistening twenty-first-century Shanghai or the broader emergence of Chinese capitalism. But it was Zhou's work that shaped the nation whose influence and power are today felt in every corner of the globe.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|05/07/2024|2024-05-07|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780674296572?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_bznEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

When Ghana declared independence from Britain in 1957, it immediately became a target for opportunists determined to lay hold of whatever assets colonialism hadn't already stripped. The military ousted the new nation's first president, Kwame Nkrumah, then falsely accused him of stealing the country's gold and hiding it overseas. Into this story stepped one of history's most charismatic scammers, John Ackah Blay-Miezah - a con man to rival the trickster god Anansi. Born into poverty, Blay-Miezah declared himself the custodian of an alleged Nkrumah trust fund worth billions. You, too, could claim a piece, if only you would help him rescue it - with a small investment. Over the 1970s and '80s, he grew his scam to epic proportions, amassing hundreds of millions of pounds from thousands of marks all over the world. He baffled Henry Kissinger, scandalised Shirley Temple-Black, and had Nixon's former attorney-general at his beck and call. Many tried to stop him, but Blay-Miezah continued to live in luxury, protected by ex-SAS soldiers while he deceived lawyers, businessmen and investigators around the globe.  In  Anansi's Gold , Yepoka Yeebo chases the ever-wilder trail of Blay-Miezah - and unfolds a riveting account of Cold War entanglements and African dreams - revealing the untold story of the grifter who beat the West at its own thieving game.||1 online resource||364.163092|ebook - ebook|08/03/2023|2023-08-03|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781526667045?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RZa7EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The ten myths that Pappe explores-repeated endlessly in the media, enforced by the military, accepted without question by the world's governments-reinforce the regional status quo. He explores the claim that Palestine was an empty land at the time of the Balfour Declaration, as well as the formation of Zionism and its role in the early decades of nation building. He asks whether the Palestinians voluntarily left their homeland in 1948, and whether June 1967 was a war of no choice. Turning to the myths surrounding the failures of the Camp David Accords and the official reasons for the attacks on Gaza, Pappe explains why the two-state solution is no longer viable.||1 online resource||956.94|ebook - ebook|04/04/2017|2017-04-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781786630209?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1W7nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Wooldridge upends many common assumptions and provides an indispensable back story to this fraught and pressing issue.''  Steven Pinker   '' The Aristocracy of Talent  provides an important and needed corrective to contemporary critiques of meritocracy. It puts meritocracy in an illuminating historical and cross-cultural perspective that shows how crucial the judgment of people by their talents rather than their bloodlines or connections has been to creating the modern world. Highly recommended''  Francis Fukuyama  *Longlisted for the   2021 Financial Times and McKinsey & Company Business Book of the Year Award*  Meritocracy: the idea that people should be advanced according to their talents rather than their status at birth. For much of history this was a revolutionary thought, but by the end of the twentieth century it had become the world''s ruling ideology. How did this happen, and why is meritocracy now under attack from both right and left?  Adrian Wooldridge traces the history of meritocracy forged by the politicians and officials who introduced the revolutionary principle of open competition, the psychologists who devised methods for measuring natural mental abilities and the educationalists who built ladders of educational opportunity. He looks outside western cultures and shows what transformative effects it has had everywhere it has been adopted, especially once women were brought into the meritocractic system. Wooldridge also shows how meritocracy has now become corrupted and argues that the recent stalling of social mobility is the result of failure to complete the meritocratic revolution. Rather than abandoning meritocracy, he says, we should call for its renewal.||1 online resource||305.513|ebook - ebook|06/03/2021|2021-06-03|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780241391501?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iPz6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Jim Sciutto.|The Return of Great Powers|Sciutto, Jim|Sciutto, Jim.|Jim Sciutto|Nonfiction., History., Politics., Electronic books.|Political Science|Instant  New York Times  Bestseller  “An absorbing account of 21st-century brinkmanship . . . . one that should be read by every legislator or presidential nominee sufficiently deluded to think that returning America to its isolationist past or making chummy with Putin is a viable option in today’s world.”  – New York Times  Book Review The essential new book by CNN anchor and chief national security analyst Jim Sciutto, identifying a new, more uncertain global order with reporting on the frontlines of power from existing wars to looming ones across the globe.        The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 dawned what Francis Fukuyama called “The End of History.” Three decades later, Jim Sciutto said on CNN’s air as the Ukraine war began, that we are living in a “1939 moment.” History never ended—it barely paused—and the global order as we long have known it is now gone. Powerful nations are determined to assert dominance on the world stage. And as their push for power escalates, a new order will affect everyone across the globe. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a part of it, but in reality, this power struggle impacts every corner of our world—from Helsinki to Beijing, from Australia to the North Pole. This is a battle with many fronts: in the Arctic, in the oceans and across the skies, on man-made islands and redrawn maps, and in tech and cyberspace.     Through globe-spanning, exclusive interviews with dozens of political, military, and intelligence leaders, Sciutto defines our times as a return of great power conflict, “a definitive break between the post–Cold War era and an entirely new and uncertain one.” With savvy, thorough, in-person reporting, he follows-up his 2019 bestseller,  The Shadow War: Inside Russia’s and China's Secret Operations to Defeat America , which focused on the covert tactics of a hidden conflict.       The Return of Great Powers  analyzes a historic and visible shift in real time. It details the realities of this new post–post–Cold War era, the increasingly aligned Russian and Chinese governments, and the flashpoint of a new, global nuclear arms race. And it poses a question: As we consider uncertain, even terrifying, outcomes, will it be possible for the West and Russia and China to prevent a new World War?||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|03/12/2024|2024-03-12|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593474150?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H5DOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Benjamin Franklin is the founding father who winks at us, the one who seems made of flesh rather than marble. In a sweeping narrative that follows Franklin's life from Boston to Philadelphia to London and Paris and back, Walter Isaacson chronicles the adventures of the runaway apprentice who became, over the course of his eighty-four-year life, America's best writer, inventor, media baron, scientist, diplomat, and business strategist, as well as one of its most practical and ingenious political leaders. He explores the wit behind  Poor Richard's Almanac  and the wisdom behind the Declaration of Independence, the new nation's alliance with France, the treaty that ended the Revolution, and the compromises that created a near-perfect Constitution. In this colorful and intimate narrative, Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklin's amazing life, showing how he helped to forge the American national identity and why he has a particular resonance in the twenty-first century., Text Difficulty 9 - Text Difficulty 10, UG/Upper grades (9th-12), 10.6 ATOS Level||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|07/01/2003|2003-07-31|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780743260848?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oIW915dDMBwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Bethany Allen, the award-winning China reporter for Axios, shows that by tying profits to political acquiescence the Chinese Communist Party is forcing companies and governments around the world to accept its rules. The coronavirus pandemic marked the first time that the Party deployed its tool kit of economic coercion on an issue directly related to the health and well-being of quite literally every person in the world. But Western democracies aren't helpless victims in Beijing's game. The West created the conditions for the rise of authoritarian capitalism by divorcing political values from market structures.  Written by one of the first American journalists to expose China's covert influence operations in the United States, Beijing Rules includes headline-making stories of Western institutions bowing to Beijing's pressure—a glimpse of what America's future may look like should liberal democracy come firmly under the thumb of authoritarian capitalism. Grounded in deep investigative reporting, it sounds the alarm about what we must do to prevent the loss of freedoms we now take for granted.||1 online resource||337.510|ebook - ebook|08/01/2023|2023-08-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780063057432?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wKBzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Patrick Radden Keefe.|Say Nothing: A True Story Of Murder and Memory In Northern Ireland|Keefe, Patrick Radden|Keefe, Patrick Radden.|Patrick Radden Keefe|Nonfiction., Military., Electronic books.|True Crime|WINNER OF THE ORWELL PRIZE FOR POLITICAL WRITING 2019 SHORTLISTED FOR THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FOR NONFICTION 2019 TIME's #1 Best Nonfiction Book of 2019 A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER 'A must read' Gillian Flynn One night in December 1972, Jean McConville, a mother of ten, was abducted from her home in Belfast and never seen alive again. Her disappearance would haunt her orphaned children, the perpetrators of this terrible crime and a whole society in Northern Ireland for decades. In this powerful, scrupulously reported book, Patrick Radden Keefe offers not just a forensic account of a brutal crime but a vivid portrait of the world in which it happened. The tragedy of an entire country is captured in the spellbinding narrative of a handful of characters, presented in lyrical and unforgettable detail. A poem by Seamus Heaney inspires the title: 'Whatever You Say, Say Nothing'. By defying the culture of silence, Keefe illuminates how a close-knit society fractured; how people chose sides in a conflict and turned to violence; and how, when the shooting stopped, some ex-combatants came to look back in horror at the atrocities they had committed, while others continue to advocate violence even today. Say Nothing deftly weaves the stories of Jean McConville and her family with those of Dolours Price, the first woman to join the IRA as a front-line soldier, who bombed the Old Bailey when barely out of her teens; Gerry Adams, who helped bring an end to the fighting, but denied his own IRA past; Brendan Hughes, a fearsome IRA commander who turned on Adams after the peace process and broke the IRA's code of silence; and other indelible figures. By capturing the intrigue, the drama and the profound human cost of the Troubles, the book presents a searing chronicle of the lengths that people are willing to go to in pursuit of a political ideal, and the ways in which societies mend - or don't - in the aftermath of a long and bloody conflict.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|11/01/2018|2018-11-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008159276?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aNNNDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

For generations, our remote ancestors have been cast as primitive and childlike-either free and equal innocents, or thuggish and warlike. Civilization, we are told, could be achieved only by sacrificing those original freedoms or, alternatively, by taming our baser instincts. David Graeber and David Wengrow show how such theories first emerged in the eighteenth century as a conservative reaction to powerful critiques of European society posed by Indigenous observers and intellectuals. Revisiting this encounter has startling implications for how we make sense of human history today, including the origins of farming, property, cities, democracy, slavery, and civilization itself. Drawing on pathbreaking research in archaeology and anthropology, the authors show how history becomes a far more interesting place once we learn to throw off our conceptual shackles and perceive what's really there. If humans did not spend 95 percent of their evolutionary past in tiny bands of hunter-gatherers, what were they doing all that time? If agriculture, and cities, did not mean a plunge into hierarchy and domination, then what kinds of social and economic organization did they lead to? The answers are often unexpected, and suggest that the course of human history may be less set in stone, and more full of playful, hopeful possibilities, than we tend to assume.  The Dawn of Everything  fundamentally transforms our understanding of the human past and offers a path toward imagining new forms of freedom, new ways of organizing society. This is a monumental book of formidable intellectual range, animated by curiosity, moral vision, and a faith in the power of direct action.

Yasheng Huang.|The Rise and Fall of the EAST|Huang, Yasheng|Huang, Yasheng.|Yasheng Huang|Nonfiction., History., Politics., Electronic books.|Political Science|The long history of Chinaâ��s relationship between stability, diversity, and prosperity, and how its current leadership threatens this delicate balance     Chinese society has been shaped by the interplay of the EASTâ��exams, autocracy, stability, and technologyâ��from ancient times through the present. Beginning with the Sui dynastyâ��s introduction of the civil service exam, known as  Keju , in 587 CEâ��and continuing through the personnel management system used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)â��Chinese autocracies have developed exceptional tools for homogenizing ideas, norms, and practices. But this uniformity came with a huge downside: stifled creativity.    Yasheng Huang shows how China transitioned from dynamism to extreme stagnation after the  Keju  was instituted. Chinaâ��s most prosperous periods, such as during the Tang dynasty (618â��907) and under the reformist CCP, occurred when its emphasis on scale (the size of bureaucracy) was balanced with scope (diversity of ideas).    Considering Chinaâ��s remarkable success over the past half-century, Huang sees signs of danger in the political and economic reversals under Xi Jinping. The CCP has again vaulted conformity above new ideas, reverting to the  Keju  model that eventually led to technological decline. It is a lesson from Chinaâ��s own history, Huang argues, that Chinese leaders would be wise to take seriously.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|08/29/2023|2023-08-29|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780300274912?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2dDPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Today, they lead to Beijing.'When The Silk Roads was published in 2015, it became an instant classic. A major reassessment of world history, it compelled us to look at the past from a different perspective. The New Silk Roads brings this story up to date, addressing the present and future of a world that is changing dramatically.   Following the Silk Roads eastwards, from Europe through to China, by way of Russia and the Middle East, The New Silk Roads provides a timely reminder that we live in a world that is profoundly interconnected. In an age of Brexit and Trump, the themes of isolation and fragmentation permeating the Western world stand in sharp contrast to events along the Silk Roads since 2015, where ties have been strengthened and mutual cooperation established. With brilliant insight, Peter Frankopan takes a fresh look at the network of relationships being formed along the length and breadth of the Silk Roads today, assessing the global reverberations of these continual shifts in the centre of power - all too often absent from headlines in the West.

Even as the country divides itself at every turn, the meritocratic ideal - that social and economic rewards should follow achievement rather than breeding - reigns supreme. Both Democrats and Republicans insistently repeat meritocratic notions. Meritocracy cuts to the heart of who we are. It sustains the American dream.    But what if, both up and down the social ladder, meritocracy is a sham? Today, meritocracy has become exactly what it was conceived to resist: a mechanism for the concentration and dynastic transmission of wealth and privilege across generations. Upward mobility has become a fantasy, and the embattled middle classes are now more likely to sink into the working poor than to rise into the professional elite. At the same time, meritocracy now ensnares even those who manage to claw their way to the top, requiring rich adults to work with crushing intensity, exploiting their expensive educations in order to extract a return. All this is not the result of deviations or retreats from meritocracy but rather stems directly from meritocracy's successes.    This is the radical argument that Daniel Markovits prosecutes with rare force. Markovits is well placed to expose the sham of meritocracy. Having spent his life at elite universities, he knows from the inside the corrosive system we are trapped within. Markovits also knows that, if we understand that meritocratic inequality produces near-universal harm, we can cure it. When  The Meritocracy Trap  reveals the inner workings of the meritocratic machine, it also illuminates the first steps outward, towards a new world that might once again afford dignity and prosperity to the American people.||1 online resource||305.550973|ebook - ebook|09/10/2019|2019-09-10|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780735222007?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sYuDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

History 20th century., Electronic books.|True Crime|Disturbing and riveting...Grann has proved himself a master of spinning delicious, many-layered mysteries that also happen to be true...It will sear your soul. -Dave Eggers, New York Times Book ReviewFrom New Yorker staff writer David Grann, #1 New York Times best-selling author of The Lost City of Z, a twisting, haunting true-life murder mystery about one of the most monstrous crimes in American history In the 1920s, the richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Indian nation in Oklahoma. After oil was discovered beneath their land, they rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe. Then, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. Her relatives were shot and poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more and more members of the tribe began to die under mysterious circumstances.  In this last remnant of the Wild West-where oilmen like J. P. Getty made their fortunes and where desperadoes like Al Spencer, the Phantom Terror, roamed-many of those who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. As the death toll climbed to more than twenty-four, the FBI took up the case. It was one of the organization's first major homicide investigations and the bureau badly bungled the case. In desperation, the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including one of the only American Indian agents in the bureau. The agents infiltrated the region, struggling to adopt the latest techniques of detection. Together with the Osage they began to expose one of the most chilling conspiracies in American history.  In Killers of the Flower Moon, David Grann revisits a shocking series of crimes in which dozens of people were murdered in cold blood. Based on years of research and startling new evidence, the book is a masterpiece of narrative nonfiction, as each step in the investigation reveals a series of sinister secrets and reversals. But more than that, it is a searing indictment of the callousness and prejudice toward American Indians that allowed the murderers to operate with impunity for so long. Killers of the Flower Moon is utterly compelling, but also emotionally devastating.||1 online resource||976.600497|ebook - ebook|04/18/2017|2017-04-18|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780385534253?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3IC7CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Keyu Jin.|The New China Playbook|Jin, Keyu|Jin, Keyu.|Keyu Jin|Nonfiction., Business., Politics., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|“Keyu Jin is a brilliant thinker.” —Tony Blair, former prime minster of the United Kingdom A myth-dispelling, comprehensive guide to the Chinese economy and its path to ascendancy.  China's economy has been booming for decades now. A formidable and emerging power on the world stage, the China that most Americans picture is only a rough sketch, based on American news coverage, policy, and ways of understanding.  Enter Keyu Jin: a world-renowned economist who was born in China, educated in the U.S., and is now a tenured professor at the London School of Economics. A person fluent in both Eastern and Western cultures, and a voice of the new generation of Chinese who represent a radical break from the past, Jin is uniquely poised to explain how China became the most successful economic story of our time, as it has shifted from primarily state-owned enterprise to an economy that is thriving in entrepreneurship, and participation in the global economy. China’s economic realm is colorful and lively, filled with paradoxes and conundrums, and Jin believes that by understanding the Chinese model, the people, the culture and history in its true perspective, one can reconcile what may appear to be contradictions to the Western eye. What follows is an illuminating account of a burgeoning world power, its past, and its potential future.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|05/16/2023|2023-05-16|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781984878298?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4QtSEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Tim Marshall.|Prisoners of Geography|Marshall, Tim|Marshall, Tim.|Tim Marshall|Nonfiction., Geopolitics, World politics, Politics., Sociology., Electronic books.|Political Science|In this New York Times bestseller, updated for 2016, an award-winning journalist uses ten maps of crucial regions to explain the geo-political strategies of the world powers-fans of geography, history, and politics (and maps) will be enthralled (Fort Worth Star-Telegram).Maps have a mysterious hold over us. Whether ancient, crumbling parchments or generated by Google, maps tell us things we want to know, not only about our current location or where we are going but about the world in general. And yet, when it comes to geo-politics, much of what we are told is generated by analysts and other experts who have neglected to refer to a map of the place in question. All leaders of nations are constrained by geography. In one of the best books about geopolitics (The Evening Standard), now updated to include 2016 geopolitical developments, journalist Tim Marshall examines Russia, China, the US, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Japan, Korea, and Greenland and the Arctic-their weather, seas, mountains, rivers, deserts, and borders-to provide a context often missing from our political reportage: how the physical characteristics of these countries affect their strengths and vulnerabilities and the decisions made by their leaders. Offering a fresh way of looking at maps (The New York Times Book Review), Marshall explains the complex geo-political strategies that shape the globe. Why is Putin so obsessed with Crimea? Why was the US destined to become a global superpower? Why does China's power base continue to expand? Why is Tibet destined to lose its autonomy? Why will Europe never be united? The answers are geographical. In an ever more complex, chaotic, and interlinked world, Prisoners of Geography is a concise and useful primer on geopolitics (Newsweek) and a critical guide to one of the major determining factors in world affairs.||1 online resource||320.12|ebook - ebook|10/27/2015|2015-10-27|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781501121487?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=umWNBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

'Gripping'   Economist   'Jaw-dropping'   Sunday Times   'Riveting'   Financial Times   'Fascinating'   Reuters   __________________________  The modern world is built on commodities - from the oil that fuels our cars to the metals that power our smartphones.    We rarely stop to consider where they come from. But we should.  In  The World for Sale , two leading journalists lift the lid on one of the least scrutinised corners of the economy: the workings of the billionaire commodity traders who buy, hoard and sell the earth's resources.  It is the story of how a handful of swashbuckling businessmen became indispensable cogs in global markets: enabling an enormous expansion in international trade, and connecting resource-rich countries - no matter how corrupt or war-torn - with the world's financial centres. And it is the story of how some traders acquired untold political power, right under the noses of Western regulators and politicians - helping Saddam Hussein to sell his oil, fuelling the Libyan rebel army during the Arab Spring, and funnelling cash to Vladimir Putin's Kremlin in spite of strict sanctions. The result is an eye-opening tour through the wildest frontiers of the global economy, as well as a revelatory guide to how capitalism really works. __________________________  A  Financial Times  Best Read of 2021.  'This jaw-dropping study shows how much money and global influence is concentrated in the hands of a tiny group . . . A remarkable book . . . As the authors roam from oilfield to wheatfield, they reveal information so staggering you almost gasp.'   SUNDAY TIMES   'Rollicking yarns from the biggest ever commodity boom . . . The high level narrative is gripping enough. But it is the details of what these freewheeling companies actually got up to that give the book a thriller-like quality . . . Educational and entertaining.'   FINANCIAL TIMES   'A fascinating and revealing story . . . There are tales in the book of breathtaking trades, such as shipments of rebel oil from war-torn Libya or deals bartered amid the brutal aluminium wars in the Russia of the 1990s.'   ECONOMIST   'A globe-spanning corporate thriller, full of intrigue and double dealing . . . Changes how we see the world, often in horrifying ways . . . New insights and reporting mean that even seasoned observers will be amazed.'   SPECTATOR   'Javier Blas and Jack Farchy should be awaiting the call from Hollywood.  The World for Sale  contains at least half a dozen narrative threads that would form the basis of a good thriller. But the authors' main achievement is to subject the biggest commodity players, and their impact on the real world, to proper critical scrutiny.'

The powerful narrative reveals the deeper meaning of the events on  The Wager , showing that it was not only the captain and crew who ended up on trial, but the very idea of empire.   A tour de force of narrative nonfiction. - The Wall Street Journal   On January 28, 1742, a ramshackle vessel of patched-together wood and cloth washed up on the coast of Brazil. Inside were thirty emaciated men, barely alive, and they had an extraordinary tale to tell. They were survivors of His Majesty's Ship the Wager, a British vessel that had left England in 1740 on a secret mission during an imperial war with Spain. While the Wager had been chasing a Spanish treasure-filled galleon known as the prize of all the oceans, it had wrecked on a desolate island off the coast of Patagonia. The men, after being marooned for months and facing starvation, built the flimsy craft and sailed for more than a hundred days, traversing nearly 3,000 miles of storm-wracked seas. They were greeted as heroes. But then ... six months later, another, even more decrepit craft landed on the coast of Chile. This boat contained just three castaways, and they told a very different story. The thirty sailors who landed in Brazil were not heroes - they were mutineers. The first group responded with countercharges of their own, of a tyrannical and murderous senior officer and his henchmen. It became clear that while stranded on the island the crew had fallen into anarchy, with warring factions fighting for dominion over the barren wilderness. As accusations of treachery and murder flew, the Admiralty convened a court martial to determine who was telling the truth. The stakes were life-and-death-for whomever the court found guilty could hang.  The Wager  is a grand tale of human behavior at the extremes told by one of our greatest nonfiction writers. Grann's recreation of the hidden world on a British warship rivals the work of Patrick O'Brian, his portrayal of the castaways' desperate straits stands up to the classics of survival writing such as  The Endurance , and his account of the court martial has the savvy of a Scott Turow thriller. As always with Grann's work, the incredible twists of the narrative hold the reader spellbound.||1 online resource||910.91641|ebook - ebook|04/18/2023|2023-04-18|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780385534277?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rwd8EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

These are dangerous times for democracy. We live in an age of winners and losers, where the odds are stacked in favor of the already fortunate. Stalled social mobility and entrenched inequality give the lie to the American credo that you can make it if you try. The consequence is a brew of anger and frustration that has fueled populist protest and extreme polarization, and led to deep distrust of both government and our fellow citizens-leaving us morally unprepared to face the profound challenges of our time. World-renowned philosopher Michael J. Sandel argues that to overcome the crises that are upending our world, we must rethink the attitudes toward success and failure that have accompanied globalization and rising inequality. Sandel shows the hubris a meritocracy generates among the winners and the harsh judgement it imposes on those left behind, and traces the dire consequences across a wide swath of American life. He offers an alternative way of thinking about success-more attentive to the role of luck in human affairs, more conducive to an ethic of humility and solidarity, and more affirming of the dignity of work.  The Tyranny of Merit  points us toward a hopeful vision of a new politics of the common good.||1 online resource||306.0973|ebook - ebook|09/15/2020|2020-09-15|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780374720995?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YCPQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Walt Bogdanich.|When McKinsey Comes to Town|Bogdanich, Walt|Bogdanich, Walt.|Walt Bogdanich, Michael Forsythe|Nonfiction., Business., Politics., Business consultants, Industrial management, Influence (Literary, artistic, etc.), Electronic books.|Business & Economics|An explosive, deeply reported exposé of McKinsey & Company, the international consulting firm that advises corporations and governments, that highlights the often drastic impact of its work on employees and citizens around the world   Meticulously reported, and ultimately devastating, this is an important book. -Patrick Radden Keefe,  New York Times  bestselling author of  Empire of Pain  and  Say Nothing   McKinsey & Company is the most prestigious consulting company in the world, earning billions of dollars in fees from major corporations and governments who turn to it to maximize their profits and enhance efficiency. McKinsey's vaunted statement of values asserts that its role is to make the world a better place, and its reputation for excellence and discretion attracts top talent from universities around the world. But what does it actually  do ? In  When McKinsey Comes to Town,  two prizewinning investigative journalists have written a portrait of the company sharply at odds with its public image. Often McKinsey's advice boils down to major cost-cutting, including layoffs and maintenance reductions, to drive up short-term profits, thereby boosting a company's stock price and the wealth of its executives who hire it, at the expense of workers and safety measures. McKinsey collects millions of dollars advising government agencies that also regulate McKinsey's corporate clients. And the firm frequently advises competitors in the same industries, but denies that this presents any conflict of interest. In one telling example, McKinsey advised a Chinese engineering company allied with the communist government which constructed artificial islands, now used as staging grounds for the Chinese Navy-while at the same time taking tens of millions of dollars from the Pentagon, whose chief aim is to counter Chinese aggression. Shielded by NDAs, McKinsey has escaped public scrutiny despite its role in advising tobacco and vaping companies, purveyors of opioids, repressive governments, and oil companies. McKinsey helped insurance companies' boost their profits by making it incredibly difficult for accident victims to get payments; worked its U.S. government contacts to let Wall Street firms evade scrutiny; enabled corruption in developing countries such as South Africa; undermined health-care programs in states across the country. And much more. Bogdanich and Forsythe have penetrated the veil of secrecy surrounding McKinsey by conducting hundreds of interviews, obtaining tens of thousands of revelatory documents, and following rule #1 of investigative reporting: Follow the money.    When McKinsey Comes to Town  is a landmark work of investigative reporting that amounts to a devastating portrait of a firm whose work has often made the world more unequal, more corrupt, and more dangerous.||1 online resource||001.068|ebook - ebook|10/04/2022|2022-10-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780385546249?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DQdlEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

I pack my bags, talk to the survivors, write my stories, then go home to wait for the next catastrophe. I don't wait very long. Journalist Patricia Evangelista came of age in the aftermath of a street revolution that forged a new future for the Philippines. Three decades later, in the face of mounting inequality, the nation discovered the fragility of its democratic institutions under the regime of strongman Rodrigo Duterte. Some People Need Killing is Evangelista's meticulously reported and deeply human chronicle of the Philippines' drug war. For six years, Evangelista chronicled the killings carried out by police and vigilantes in the name of Duterte's war on drugs - a war that has led to the slaughter of thousands - immersing herself in the world of killers and survivors and capturing the atmosphere of fear created when an elected president decides that some lives are worth less than others. The book takes its title from a vigilante whose words seemed to reflect the psychological accommodation that most of the country had made: 'I'm really not a bad guy,' he said. 'I'm not all bad. Some people need killing.' A profound act of witness and a tour de force of literary journalism, Some People Need Killing is also a brilliant dissection of the grammar of violence and an important investigation of the human impulses to dominate and resist.||1 online resource||364.134|ebook - ebook|11/02/2023|2023-11-02|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781804710074?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ag-9EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Why Nations Fail sets out to answer this question, with a compelling and elegantly argued new theory: that it is not down to climate, geography or culture, but because of institutions. Drawing on an extraordinary range of contemporary and historical examples, from ancient Rome through the Tudors to modern-day China, leading academics Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson show that to invest and prosper, people need to know that if they work hard, they can make money and actually keep it - and this means sound institutions that allow virtuous circles of innovation, expansion and peace.   Based on fifteen years of research, and answering the competing arguments of authors ranging from Max Weber to Jeffrey Sachs and Jared Diamond, Acemoglu and Robinson step boldly into the territory of Francis Fukuyama and Ian Morris.

The Shortest History books deliver thousands of years of history in one riveting, fast-paced read.      The ongoing struggle between Israel and Palestine is one of the most bitter conflicts in history, with profound global consequences. In this book, Middle East expert Michael Scott-Baumann succinctly describes its origins and charts its evolution from civil war to the present day. Each chapter offers a lucid explanation of the politics and ends with personal testimony from Palestinians and Israelis whose lives have been impacted by the dispute.     While presenting competing interpretations, Scott-Baumann examines the key flashpoints, including the early role of the British, the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, the Six Day War of 1967, and the Trump administration's peace plan, pitched as the deal of the century, in 2020. He delineates both the nature of Israeli control over the Palestinian territories and Palestinian resistance-going to the heart of the clashes in recent decades. The result is an indispensable history, including a timeline, glossary, and analysis of why efforts to restore peace have continually failed and what it will take to succeed.||1 online resource||956.04|ebook - ebook|02/28/2023|2023-02-28|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781615199518?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OKJtEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Retracing his own spiritual journey from atheism to faith, Lee Strobel, former legal editor of the Chicago Tribune, cross-examines a dozen experts with doctorates from schools like Cambridge, Princeton, and Brandeis who are recognized authorities in their own fields. Strobel challenges them with questions like, How reliable is the New Testament? Does evidence for Jesus exist outside the Bible? Is there any reason to believe the resurrection was an actual event? Winner of the Gold Medallion Book Award and twice nominated for the Christian Book of the Year Award, Strobel's tough, point-blank questions read like a captivating, fast-paced novel. But it's not fiction. It's a riveting quest for the truth about history's most compelling figure. The new edition includes scores of revisions and additions, including updated material on archaeological and manuscript discoveries, fresh recommendations for further study, and an interview with the author that tells dramatic stories about the book's impact, provides behind-the-scenes information, and responds to critiques of the book by skeptics. As The Case for Christ and its ancillary resources approach 10 million copies in print, this updated edition will prove even more valuable to contemporary readers.||1 online resource||232.908|ebook - ebook|09/06/2016|2016-09-06|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780310346166?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_Q7xCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Desmond Shum.|Red Roulette|Shum, Desmond|Shum, Desmond.|Desmond Shum|Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., Business., History., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|A unique and incendiary memoir from an entrepreneur who rose to the highest realms of power and money in China and whose wife was disappeared,  Red Roulette  reveals the truth of what is happening inside the country's wealth-making machine.       After the Communist Revolution, Desmond Shum's grandfather was marked as belonging to a black category that included former landlords and rich peasants-meaning the Shums would be stigmatized and impoverished. As Desmond was growing up, he vowed his life would be different.   Through hard work and sheer tenacity Shum earned an American college degree and returned to China to establish himself in business. There, he met his future wife, the highly intelligent and equally ambitious Whitney Duan who was determined to make her mark within China's male-dominated society. Whitney and Desmond formed an effective team and, aided by relationships they formed with top members of the red aristocracy, vaulted into China's billionaire class. Soon they were developing the massive air cargo facility at Beijing International Airport, and they followed that feat with the creation of one of Beijing's premier hotels. They were dazzlingly successful, traveling in private jets, funding multi-million-dollar buildings and endowments, and purchasing expensive homes, vehicles, and art.   But in 2017, their fates diverged irrevocably when Desmond, while residing overseas with his son, learned that his now ex-wife Whitney had vanished along with three coworkers.   This is both Desmond's story and Whitney's, because she cannot tell it herself.||1 online resource||338.092|ebook - ebook|09/07/2021|2021-09-07|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781982156176?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4d0YEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Dr. David Daokui Li has served as an advisor to senior Chinese Communist Party leaders as well as major multinational corporations and international economic institutions. Writing in response to the growing anti-Chinese sentiment and alarmed by the threat of war, Dr. Li pulls from his wealth of firsthand experience to demystify contemporary Chinese society and advocate for understanding between China and the West. In this urgently needed and fascinating book, he explains the inner workings of a rising superpower to help the world understand how it works—and how to work with it.   In Li's hands, an economic and political system that often baffles Westerners becomes coherent, sophisticated, and logical. He begins by explaining how two thousand years of history—from Confucian philosophy and ancient imperial dynasties to Communist Party chairmen from Mao to Deng Xiaoping—profoundly influence China's leadership today. Li brings the reader into high-level meetings he attended with figures including Xi Jinping, showing China's approach to governance.   Many Westerners imagine that China's economy and society are as rigid and ideological as Soviet Russia. In his far-reaching exploration of the Chinese economy—from state-owned enterprises, private businesses, the stock market, education, media and the internet to real estate, the environment, and much more—Li reveals that China's economy and society are in fact diverse, dynamic, and flexible.   In demystifying contemporary Chinese society, Li helps readers reconceptualize contemporary China and the implications of its growth. He asserts that China's rise will be beneficial for the global order, holding out the hope that with shared understanding and mutual learning the Chinese and Western systems will eventually find a way to peacefully coexist.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|01/09/2024|2024-01-09|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780393292404?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SaW-EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Now, in The Prodigal God, Keller takes his trademark intellectual approach to understanding Christianity and uses the parable of the Prodigal Son to reveal an unexpected message of hope and salvation.  Within that parable Jesus reveals God's prodigal grace toward both the irreligious and the moralistic.

Party of One  shatters the many myths and caricatures that shroud one of the world's most secretive political organizations and its leader. Many observers misread Xi during his early years in power, projecting their own hopes that he would steer China toward more political openness, rule of law, and pro-market economics. Having masked his beliefs while climbing the party hierarchy, Xi has centralized decision-making powers, encouraged a cult of personality around himself, and moved toward indefinite rule by scrapping presidential term limits—stirring fears of a return to a Mao-style dictatorship. Today, the party of Xi favors political zeal over technical expertise, trumpets its faith in Marxism, and proclaims its reach into every corner of Chinese society with Xi portraits and hammer-and-sickle logos. Under Xi, China has challenged Western preeminence in global affairs and cast its authoritarian system as a model of governance worthy of international emulation.   As a China reporter for the  Wall Street Journal , Chun Han Wong has chronicled Xi Jinping's hard-line strategy for crushing dissent against his strongman rule, his political repression in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, and his increasingly coercive efforts to reel in the island democracy of Taiwan, as well as the domestic and diplomatic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. When the Chinese government refused to renew Wong's press credentials and forced him to leave mainland China in 2019, he moved to Hong Kong to continue covering Chinese politics and its autocratic turn under Xi. Now, Wong has drawn on his years of firsthand reporting across China—including conversations with party insiders, insights from scholars and diplomats, and analyses of official speeches and documents—to create a lucid and historically rooted account of China's leader and how he inspires fear and fervor in his party, his nation, and beyond.   Timely, revelatory, and important,  Party of One  explains how the future Xi imagines for China will reshape the future of the entire world.||1 online resource||951.0612092|ebook - ebook|05/23/2023|2023-05-23|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781982185756?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VOmUEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Steven D Levitt.|Freakonomics Rev Ed|Levitt, Steven D.|Levitt, Steven D.|Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner|Nonfiction., Business., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? How did the legalization of abortion affect the rate of violent crime?    These may not sound like typical questions for an econo-mist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much-heralded scholar who studies the riddles of everyday life--from cheating and crime to sports and child-rearing--and whose conclusions turn conventional wisdom on its head.     Freakonomics is a groundbreaking collaboration between Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, an award-winning author and journalist. They usually begin with a mountain of data and a simple question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.    Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives--how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they explore the hidden side of . . . well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Klu Klux Klan.     What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a great deal of complexity and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and--if the right questions are asked--is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking.     Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.    Bonus material added to the revised and expanded 2006 edition     The original New York Times Magazine article about Steven D. Levitt by Stephen J. Dubner, which led to the creation of this book.    Seven �Freakonomics� columns written for the New York Times Magazine, published between August 2005 and April 2006.

Matthew Desmond.|Evicted|Desmond, Matthew|Desmond, Matthew.|Matthew Desmond|Nonfiction., Politics., Sociology., Electronic books., Electronic book|Social Science|New York Times BestsellerFinalist for the 2016 Kirkus Prize for NonfictionFrom Harvard sociologist and MacArthur Genius Matthew Desmond, a landmark work of scholarship and reportage that will forever change the way we look at poverty in America  In this brilliant, heartbreaking book, Matthew Desmond takes us into the poorest neighborhoods of Milwaukee to tell the story of eight families on the edge. Arleen is a single mother trying to raise her two sons on the $20 a month she has left after paying for their rundown apartment. Scott is a gentle nurse consumed by a heroin addiction. Lamar, a man with no legs and a neighborhood full of boys to look after, tries to work his way out of debt. Vanetta participates in a botched stickup after her hours are cut. All are spending almost everything they have on rent, and all have fallen behind. The fates of these families are in the hands of two landlords: Sherrena Tarver, a former schoolteacher turned inner-city entrepreneur, and Tobin Charney, who runs one of the worst trailer parks in Milwaukee. They loathe some of their tenants and are fond of others, but as Sherrena puts it, Love don't pay the bills. She moves to evict Arleen and her boys a few days before Christmas. Even in the most desolate areas of American cities, evictions used to be rare. But today, most poor renting families are spending more than half of their income on housing, and eviction has become ordinary, especially for single mothers. In vivid, intimate prose, Desmond provides a ground-level view of one of the most urgent issues facing America today. As we see families forced into shelters, squalid apartments, or more dangerous neighborhoods, we bear witness to the human cost of America's vast inequality—and to people's determination and intelligence in the face of hardship. Based on years of embedded fieldwork and painstakingly gathered data, this masterful book transforms our understanding of extreme poverty and economic exploitation while providing fresh ideas for solving a devastating, uniquely American problem. Its unforgettable scenes of hope and loss remind us of the centrality of home, without which nothing else is possible.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|03/01/2016|2016-03-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780553447446?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-QYZCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Between 1947 and 1949, over 400 Palestinian villages were deliberately destroyed, civilians were massacred and around a million men, women, and children were expelled from their homes at gunpoint.   Denied for almost six decades, had it happened today it could only have been called ethnic cleansing. Decisively debunking the myth that the Palestinian population left of their own accord in the course of this war, Ilan Pappe offers impressive archival evidence to demonstrate that, from its very inception, a central plank in Israel's founding ideology was the forcible removal of the indigenous population.

An instant American classic.-Dwight Garner,  The New York Times    As we go about our daily lives, caste is the wordless usher in a darkened theater, flashlight cast down in the aisles, guiding us to our assigned seats for a performance. The hierarchy of caste is not about feelings or morality. It is about power-which groups have it and which do not.    In this brilliant book, Isabel Wilkerson gives us a masterful portrait of an unseen phenomenon in America as she explores, through an immersive, deeply researched narrative and stories about real people, how America today and throughout its history has been shaped by a hidden caste system, a rigid hierarchy of human rankings.   Beyond race, class, or other factors, there is a powerful caste system that influences people's lives and behavior and the nation's fate. Linking the caste systems of America, India, and Nazi Germany, Wilkerson explores eight pillars that underlie caste systems across civilizations, including divine will, bloodlines, stigma, and more. Using riveting stories about people-including Martin Luther King, Jr., baseball's Satchel Paige, a single father and his toddler son, Wilkerson herself, and many others-she shows the ways that the insidious undertow of caste is experienced every day. She documents how the Nazis studied the racial systems in America to plan their out-cast of the Jews; she discusses why the cruel logic of caste requires that there be a bottom rung for those in the middle to measure themselves against; she writes about the surprising health costs of caste, in depression and life expectancy, and the effects of this hierarchy on our culture and politics. Finally, she points forward to ways America can move beyond the artificial and destructive separations of human divisions, toward hope in our common humanity. Beautifully written, original, and revealing,  Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents  is an eye-opening story of people and history, and a reexamination of what lies under the surface of ordinary lives and of American life today.||1 online resource||305.5122|ebook - ebook|08/04/2020|2020-08-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593230268?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HcLNDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

And one of the triggers for that war would be a nuclear missile inbound toward the United States.      Every generation, a journalist has looked deep into the heart of the nuclear military establishment: the technologies, the safeguards, the plans, and the risks. These investigations are vital to how we understand the world we really live in—where one nuclear missile will beget one in return, and where the choreography of the world’s end requires massive decisions made on seconds’ notice with information that is only as good as the intelligence we have.     Pulitzer Prize finalist Annie Jacobsen’s  Nuclear War: A Scenario  explores this ticking-clock scenario, based on dozens of exclusive new interviews with military and civilian experts who have built the weapons, have been privy to the response plans, and have been responsible for those decisions should they have needed to be made.  Nuclear War: A Scenario  examines the handful of minutes after a nuclear missile launch. It is essential reading, and unlike any other book in its depth and urgency.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|03/26/2024|2024-03-26|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593476109?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dlnKEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Though the bag is often seen dangling from the arms of celebrities, there is a fabled waiting list of more than two years to buy one from Hermès, and the average fashionista has a better chance of climbing Mount Everest in Prada pumps than of possessing one of these coveted carryalls. Unless, of course, she happens to know Michael Tonello . . .Michael's newfound career started with an impulsive move to Barcelona, a vanished job assignment, no work visa, and an Hermès scarf sold on eBay to generate some quick cash. But soon the resourceful Michael discovered the truth about the waiting list and figured out the secret to getting Hermès to part with one of these precious bags. Millions of dollars worth of Birkins later, Michael had become one of eBay's most successful entrepreneurs-and a Robin Hood to thousands of desperate rich women.With down-to-earth wit, Michael chronicles the unusual ventures that took him to nearly every continent, from eBay to Paris auction house and into the lives of celebrities and poseurs. Flirting with danger, Michael recounts the heady rush of hand delivering his first big score to famed songwriter Carole Bayer Sager in Paris; how he had to hire thugs to rescue a bag that one of his shoppers held for ransom; and the story of the Oscar-worthy performances that allowed him to snag reserved bags from other, less dogged Birkin seekers.Whether he's relating his wining and dining, buying and selling, dodging and weaving, laughing and crying, or schmoozing and stammering, Michael is a master raconteur who weaves together tales of hunting Birkins in the world's most posh locales, memories of meals that would make any gastronome salivate, anecdotes of obsessed collectors with insatiable desires, and sweetly intimate stories about his family, friends, and finding true love. The result is a memoir that is distinctive, fun, page-turning, and as addictive as its namesake.||1 online resource||381.177092|ebook - ebook|04/16/2024|2008-07-08|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780061734212?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FSx3dUPUwGkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Graham Allison.|Destined for War|Allison, Graham|Allison, Graham T.|Graham Allison|Nonfiction., History., Politics., Electronic books.|Political Science|China and the United States are heading toward a war neither wants.The reason is Thucydides's Trap, a deadly pattern of structural stress that results when a rising power challenges a ruling one. This phenomenon is as old as history itself. About the Peloponnesian War that devastated ancient Greece, the historian Thucydides explained: 'It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta that made war inevitable.' Over the past 500 years, these conditions have occurred sixteen times. War broke out in twelve of them.Today, as an unstoppable China approaches an immovable America, and both Xi Jinping and Donald Trump promise to make their countries 'great again', the seventeenth case looks grim. Unless China is willing to scale back its ambitions or Washington can accept becoming number two in the Pacific, a trade conflict, cyberattack, or accident at sea could soon escalate into all-out war.In Destined for War, the eminent Harvard scholar Graham Allison explains why Thucydides's Trap is the best lens for understanding U.S.-China relations in the twenty-first century. Through uncanny historical parallels and war scenarios, he shows how close we are to the unthinkable. Yet, stressing that war is not inevitable, Allison also reveals how clashing powers have kept the peace in the past-and what painful steps the United States and China must take to avoid disaster today.|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|07/03/2017|2017-07-03|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781925548372?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AfYnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

A book of beauty ' -  Gerard DeGroot,    The Times   In August 1765 the East India Company defeated the young Mughal emperor and forced him to establish in his richest provinces a new administration run by English merchants who collected taxes through means of a ruthless private army - what we would now call an act of involuntary privatisation. The East India Company's founding charter authorised it to 'wage war' and it had always used violence to gain its ends. But the creation of this new government marked the moment that the East India Company ceased to be a conventional international trading corporation dealing in silks and spices and became something much more unusual: an aggressive colonial power in the guise of a multinational business. In less than four decades it had trained up a security force of around 200,000 men - twice the size of the British army - and had subdued an entire subcontinent, conquering first Bengal and finally, in 1803, the Mughal capital of Delhi itself. The Company's reach stretched until almost all of India south of the Himalayas was effectively ruled from a boardroom in London.  The Anarchy  tells the remarkable story of how one of the world's most magnificent empires disintegrated and came to be replaced by a dangerously unregulated private company, based thousands of miles overseas in one small office, five windows wide, and answerable only to its distant shareholders. In his most ambitious and riveting book to date, William Dalrymple tells the story of the East India Company as it has never been told before, unfolding a timely cautionary tale of the first global corporate power.||1 online resource||954.031|ebook - ebook|09/10/2019|2019-09-10|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781408864401?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-T2lDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Talmud says: If someone comes to kill you, rise up and kill him first. This instinct to take every measure, even the most aggressive, to defend the Jewish people is hardwired into Israel's DNA. From the very beginning of its statehood in 1948, protecting the nation from harm has been the responsibility of its intelligence community and armed services, and there is one weapon in their vast arsenal that they have relied upon to thwart the most serious threats: Targeted assassinations have been used countless times, on enemies large and small, sometimes in response to attacks against the Israeli people and sometimes preemptively.In this page-turning, eye-opening book, journalist and military analyst Ronen Bergman-praised by David Remnick as arguably [Israel's] best investigative reporter-offers a riveting inside account of the targeted killing programs: their successes, their failures, and the moral and political price exacted on the men and women who approved and carried out the missions. Bergman has gained the exceedingly rare cooperation of many current and former members of the Israeli government, including Prime Ministers Shimon Peres, Ehud Barak, Ariel Sharon, and Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as high-level figures in the country's military and intelligence services: the IDF (Israel Defense Forces), the Mossad (the world's most feared intelligence agency), Caesarea (a Mossad within the Mossad that carries out attacks on the highest-value targets), and the Shin Bet (an internal security service that implemented the largest targeted assassination campaign ever, in order to stop what had once appeared to be unstoppable: suicide terrorism). Including never-before-reported, behind-the-curtain accounts of key operations, and based on hundreds of on-the-record interviews and thousands of files to which Bergman has gotten exclusive access over his decades of reporting, Rise and Kill First brings us deep into the heart of Israel's most secret activities. Bergman traces, from statehood to the present, the gripping events and thorny ethical questions underlying Israel's targeted killing campaign, which has shaped the Israeli nation, the Middle East, and the entire world.Authoritative . . . a chilling portrait of the evolution of the assassination program.-The Washington Post||1 online resource||320.95694|ebook - ebook|01/31/2018|2018-01-30|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780679604686?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3UXKDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Patrick Radden Keefe.|Empire of Pain|Keefe, Patrick Radden|Keefe, Patrick Radden|Patrick Radden Keefe|Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., Business., True Crime., Electronic books.|Biography & Autobiography|NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE NOMINEE  •  A  NEW YORK TIMES  NOTABLE BOOK OF THE YEAR •  NEW YORK TIMES  BEST SELLER • A grand, devastating portrait of three generations of the Sackler family, famed for their philanthropy, whose fortune was built by Valium and whose reputation was destroyed by OxyContin. From the prize-winning and bestselling author of  Say Nothing     The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama-baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful. The Sackler name has adorned the walls of many storied institutions-Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis.    Empire of Pain  begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm. Arthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury. Forty years later, Raymond's son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium-co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug's addictiveness-was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die.  This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d'Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.   Empire of Pain  chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability.    Empire of Pain  is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the excesses of America's second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to human suffering that built one of the world's great fortunes.||1 online resource||338.7616151|ebook - ebook|04/13/2021|2021-04-13|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780385545693?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

With the completion of their life's work they look back and ask what history has to say about the nature, the conduct and the prospects of man, seeking in the great lives, the great ideas, the great events of the past for the meaning of man's long journey through war, conquest and creation - and for the great themes that can help us to understand our own era.To the Durants, history is not merely a warning reminder of man's follies and crimes, but also an encouraging remembrance of generative souls...a spacious country of the mind, wherein a thousand saints, statesmen, inventors, scientists, poets, artists, musicians, lovers, and philosophers still live and speak, teach and carve and sing....Designed to accompany the ten-volume set of The Story of Civilization, The Lessons of History is, in its own right, a profound and original work of history and philosophy.||1 online resource||901|ebook - ebook|08/21/2012|2012-08-21|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781439170199?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LWNQ2_4wkocC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Tim Alberta.|The Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory|Alberta, Tim|Alberta, Tim.|Tim Alberta|Nonfiction., Politics., Religion & Spirituality., Electronic books.|Political Science|New York Times Bestseller    One of Barack Obama's Favorite Books of the Year    An Air Mail Best Book of the Year    The award-winning journalist and staff writer for The Atlantic follows up his New York Times bestseller American Carnage with this timely, rigorously reported, and deeply personal examination of the divisions that threaten to destroy the American evangelical movement.   Evangelical Christians are perhaps the most polarizing—and least understood—people living in America today. In his seminal new book, The Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, journalist Tim Alberta, himself a practicing Christian and the son of an evangelical pastor, paints an expansive and profoundly troubling portrait of the American evangelical movement. Through the eyes of televangelists and small-town preachers, celebrity revivalists and everyday churchgoers, Alberta tells the story of a faith cheapened by ephemeral fear, a promise corrupted by partisan subterfuge, and a reputation stained by perpetual scandal.  For millions of conservative Christians, America is their kingdom—a land set apart, a nation uniquely blessed, a people in special covenant with God. This love of country, however, has given way to right-wing nationalist fervor, a reckless blood-and-soil idolatry that trivializes the kingdom of Jesus Christ. Alberta retraces the arc of the modern evangelical movement, placing political and cultural inflection points in the context of church teachings and traditions, explaining how Donald Trump's presidency and the COVID-19 pandemic only accelerated historical trends that long pointed toward disaster. Reporting from half-empty sanctuaries and standing-room-only convention halls across the country, the author documents a growing fracture inside American Christianity and journeys with readers through this strange new environment in which loving your enemies is woke and owning the libs is the answer to WWJD.  Accessing the highest echelons of the American evangelical movement, Alberta investigates the ways in which conservative Christians have pursued, exercised, and often abused power in the name of securing this earthly kingdom. He highlights the battles evangelicals are fighting—and the weapons of their warfare—to demonstrate the disconnect from scripture: Contra the dictates of the New Testament, today's believers are struggling mightily against flesh and blood, eyes fixed on the here and now, desperate for a power that is frivolous and fleeting. Lingering at the intersection of real cultural displacement and perceived religious persecution, Alberta portrays a rapidly secularizing America that has come to distrust the evangelical church, and weaves together present-day narratives of individual pastors and their churches as they confront the twin challenges of lost status and diminished standing.  Sifting through the wreckage—pastors broken, congregations battered, believers losing their religion because of sex scandals and political schemes—Alberta asks: If the American evangelical movement has ceased to glorify God, what is its purpose?||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|12/05/2023|2023-12-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780063226906?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cjGsEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Uri Kaufman.|Eighteen Days in October|Kaufman, Uri|Kaufman, Uri.|Uri Kaufman|Nonfiction., History., Military., Electronic books.|History|Pacy and enthralling. — Financial Times  Tells the story brilliantly. —Senator Joseph I. Lieberman Stimulating and insightful...will no doubt find a permanent place on the Arab-Israeli bookshelf. —Michael Oren,  New York Times  bestselling author of  Six Days of War   October 2023 marks the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War, a conflict that shaped the modern Middle East. The War was a trauma for Israel, a dangerous superpower showdown, and, following the oil embargo, a pivotal reordering of the global economic order. The Jewish State came shockingly close to defeat. A panicky cabinet meeting debated the use of nuclear weapons. After the war, Prime Minister Golda Meir resigned in disgrace, and a 9/11-style commission investigated the debacle. But, argues Uri Kaufman, from the perspective of a half century, the War can be seen as a pivotal victory for Israel. After nearly being routed, the Israeli Defense Force clawed its way back to threaten Cairo and Damascus. In the war's aftermath both sides had to accept unwelcome truths: Israel could no longer take military superiority for granted—but the Arabs could no longer hope to wipe Israel off the map. A straight line leads from the battlefields of 1973 to the Camp David Accords of 1978 and all the treaties since. Like Michael Oren's  Six Days of War , this is the definitive account of a critical moment in history.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|08/29/2023|2023-08-29|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781250281890?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iYaFEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The most compelling account of King's life in a generation. —Mark Whitaker,  The Washington Post     Named a most anticipated book of 2023 by  The Washington Post ,  The Millions , and  Literary Hub     The first full biography in decades,  King  mixes revelatory and exhaustive new research with brisk and accessible storytelling to forge the definitive life for our times.   Vividly written and exhaustively researched, Jonathan Eig's  King: A Life  is the first major biography in decades of the civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.—and the first to include recently declassified FBI files. In this revelatory new portrait of the preacher and activist who shook the world, the bestselling biographer gives us an intimate view of the courageous and often emotionally troubled human being who demanded peaceful protest for his movement but was rarely at peace with himself. He casts fresh light on the King family's origins as well as MLK's complex relationships with his wife, father, and fellow activists.  King  reveals a minister wrestling with his own human frailties and dark moods, a citizen hunted by his own government, and a man determined to fight for justice even if it proved to be a fight to the death. As he follows MLK from the classroom to the pulpit to the streets of Birmingham, Selma, and Memphis, Eig dramatically re-creates the journey of a man who recast American race relations and became our only modern-day founding father—as well as the nation's most mourned martyr. In this landmark biography, Eig gives us an MLK for our times: a deep thinker, a brilliant strategist, and a committed radical who led one of history's greatest movements, and whose demands for racial and economic justice remain as urgent today as they were in his lifetime.

Tyler Kepner.||Kepner, Tyler|Kepner, Tyler.||Nonfiction., Sports & Recreations., Electronic books.||From the  New York Times  bestselling author of  K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches  comes the ultimate history of the World Series-a vivid portrait of baseball at its finest and most intense, filled with humor, lore, analysis, and fascinating behind-the-scenes stories from 117 years of the Fall Classic.  The World Series is the most enduring showcase in American team sports. It's the place where legends are made, where celebration and devastation can hinge on a fly ball off a foul pole or a grounder beneath a first baseman's glove. And there's no one better to bring this rich history to life than  New York Times  national baseball columnist Tyler Kepner, whose bestselling book about pitching,  K , was lauded as Michelangelo explaining the brush strokes on the Sistine Chapel by  Newsday . In seven scintillating chapters, Kepner delivers an indelible portrait of baseball's signature event. He digs deep for essential tales dating back to the beginning in 1903, adding insights from Hall of Famers like Reggie Jackson, Mike Schmidt, Jim Palmer, Dennis Eckersley and many others who have thrived - and failed - when it mattered most. Why do some players, like Madison Bumgarner, Derek Jeter and David Ortiz, crave the pressure? How do players handle a dream that comes up short? What's it like to manage in the World Series, and what are the secrets of building a champion? Kepner celebrates unexpected heroes like Bill Wambsganss, who pulled off an unassisted triple play in 1920, probes the mysteries behind magic moments (Did Babe Ruth call his shot in 1932? How could Eckersley walk Mike Davis to get to Kirk Gibson in 1988?) and busts some long-time myths (the 1919 Reds were much better than the Black Sox, anyway).    The Grandest Stage  is the ultimate history of the World Series, the perfect gift for all the fans who feel their hearts pounding in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game Seven.||1 online resource||796.3576461|ebook - ebook|10/11/2022||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780385546263?s=MD|

Rana Mitter, Guardian In October 1839, Britain entered the first Opium War with China. Its brutality notwithstanding, the conflict was also threaded with tragicomedy: with Victorian hypocrisy, bureaucratic fumblings, military missteps, political opportunism and collaboration. Yet over the past hundred and seventy years, this strange tale of misunderstanding, incompetence and compromise has become the founding episode of modern Chinese nationalism. Starting from this first conflict, The Opium War explores how China's national myths mould its interactions with the outside world, how public memory is spun to serve the present, and how delusion and prejudice have bedevilled its relationship with the modern West.

David Van Reybrouck.|Revolusi|Reybrouck, David Van|Van Reybrouck, David.|David Van Reybrouck|Nonfiction., History., Politics., Electronic books.|History|A story of staggering scope and drama,  Revolusi  is the masterful and definitive account of the epic revolution that sparked the decolonisation of the modern world.  'Astounding . . . history at its best' Yuval Harari 'Utterly compelling'  Financial Times  'Superb'  Guardian  On a sunny Friday morning in August 1945, a handful of tired people raised a homemade cotton flag and on behalf of 68 million compatriots announced the birth of a new nation: Indonesia. Four million civilians had died during the Japanese wartime occupation that ousted its Dutch colonial regime. Another 200,000 people would lose their lives in the astonishingly brutal conflict that ensued - as the Dutch used savage violence to reassert their control, and as Britain and America became embroiled in pacifying Indonesia's guerrilla war of resistance: the 'Revolusi'. It was not until December 1949 that the newly created United Nations finally brought the conflict an end - and with it, 350 years of colonial rule - setting a precedent that would reshape the world. Drawing on hundreds of interviews and eye-witness testimonies, David Van Reybrouck turns this vast and complex story into an utterly gripping narrative that is alive with human detail at every turn. A landmark publication,  Revolusi  shows Indonesia's struggle for independence to be one of the defining dramas of the twentieth century.  'A magnificent fusion of oral history, sparkling analysis, and historical wisdom.

Biography., Nonfiction., Islam 21st century., Religion & Spirituality., Electronic books.|Religion|From the bestselling writer of 'The History of God' and the widely acclaimed 'Islam - A Short History' comes Karen Armstrong's 'Muhammad'.Muhammad was born in 570 C.E., and over the following sixty years built a thriving spiritual community, laying the foundations of a religion that changed the course of world history. There is more historical data on his life than on that of the founder of any other major faith, and yet his story is consistently misunderstood, and subject to much distortion and error. This story is more relevant now than ever, offering crucial insight into the true origins of an increasingly radicalized Islam.An acclaimed authority on religious and spiritual issues, Karen Armstrong offers a balanced portrait of this revered figure. Through comparison with other prophets and mystics, she illuminates Muhammad's spiritual ideas; she uses the facts of his life, from which Muslims have drawn instruction for centuries, to make the tenets of Islam clear and accessible for modern readers of all faiths. This is an immaculately researched new biography of Muhammad that dismantles centuries of misconceptions to reveal the man at the heart of Islam.||1 online resource||297.63|ebook - ebook|10/15/2009|2009-10-15|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780007347599?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CbtSUjaXbVwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Shibani Mahtani.|Among the Braves|Mahtani, Shibani|Mahtani, Shibani.|Shibani Mahtani, Timothy McLaughlin|Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., History., Politics., Electronic books.|Political Science|Through the eyes of two frontline journalists comes a gripping narrative history of the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement centered around a cast of four core activists, culminating in the 2019 mass protests and Beijing's brutal crackdown.    Hong Kong was an experiment in governance. Handed back to China in 1997 after 156 years of British rule, it was meant to be a carve-out between hostile systems: a bridge between communism and capitalism, authoritarianism and liberal democracy. “One country, two systems” kept its media free, its courts independent and its protests boisterous, designed also to convince Taiwan of a peaceful solution to Beijing’s desire for reunification.  Yet this formulation excluded Hong Kong’s own people, their future negotiated by political titans in faraway capitals. In 2019, an ill-conceived law spear-headed by a sycophantic leader pushed millions to take to the streets in one of the most enduring protest movements the world has ever seen. Xi Jinping responded with a draconian national security law that sought not only to end the demonstrations but quash the “problem” of Hong Kongers’ identity and desire for freedom.  Reverend Chu, who believed Hong Kong had to carry the spirit of students at Tiananmen Square, saw his silver-haired comrades who birthed the city’s modern pro-democracy movement handcuffed and taken from their homes. Tommy, an art student radicalized into throwing Molotov cocktails, watched “braves” like him brutalized by police before his own arrest prompted him to flee. Finn epitomized the decentralized nature of the movement and its internet-fueled victories, but online anonymity couldn’t stop his life from unravelling. Gwyneth could predict her eventual fate when she chose to give up her career as a journalist to stand for election as an opposition candidate, and did it anyway.  In  Among the Braves,  Shibani Mahtani and Timothy McLaughlin tell the story of Hong Kong’s past, and what the sacrifices of its people mean for global democracy’s shaky foundation.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|11/07/2023|2023-11-07|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780306830389?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rDGyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Capitalism didn't fail, it was ruined...   What went wrong with capitalism? Ruchir Sharma's account is not like any you will have heard before. He says progressives are right, in part, when they mock modern capitalism as socialism for the rich. For a century, governments have expanded in just about every measurable dimension, from spending to regulation and the scale of financial rescues when the economy wobbles. The result is expensive state guarantees for everyone—bailouts for the rich, entitlements for the middle class, welfare for the poor.   Taking you back to the 19th century, Sharma shows how completely the reflexes of government have changed: from hands-off to hands-on, from doing too little to help anyone in hard times to today trying to prevent anyone suffering any economic pain, ever. Trading sins of omission and indifference for excesses of spending and meddling, governments from the United States to Europe and Japan have pumped so much money into their economies that financial markets can no longer invest all that capital efficiently.    Inadvertently, they have fueled the rise of monopolies, zombie firms, and billionaires. They have made capitalism less fair and less efficient, which is slowing economic growth and fueling popular anger. The first step to a cure is a correct diagnose of the problem. Capitalism has been badly distorted by constant government intervention and the relentless spread of a bailout culture. Building an even bigger state will only double down on what ruined capitalism in the first place.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|06/11/2024|2024-06-11|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781668008287?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZU7dEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

This book has created a storm of controversy by bringing out into the open America's relationship with the Israel lobby: a loose coalition of individuals and organizations that actively work to shape foreign policy in a way that is profoundly damaging both to the United States and Israel itself.   Israel is an important, valued American ally, yet Mearsheimer and Walt show that, by encouraging unconditional US financial and diplomatic support for Israel and promoting the use of its power to remake the Middle East, the lobby has jeopardized America's and Israel's long-term security and put other countries - including Britain - at risk.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|06/26/2008|2008-06-26|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780141920665?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2iUdyQs_NhYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

But it wasn't long before she was carefully plotting a route that would cover 45,000 miles-almost twice the circumference of the earth-coasting along the world's most remarkable railways; from the cloud-skimming heights of Tibet's Qinghai railway to silk-sheeted splendour on the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.Packing up her rucksack-and her fiancé, Jem-Monisha embarks on an unforgettable adventure that will take her from London's St Pancras station to the vast expanses of Russia and Mongolia, North Korea, Canada, Kazakhstan, and beyond.

But why?   Europe has forgiven Germany's war crimes, why can't Japan's neighbours do likewise? To what extent do the ongoing state-level disputes about island ownership, war history, controversial shrines and statues, missile systems and military escalation reflect how the people of these countries regard each other? They have so much to gain from amicable relations, so why do they seem to be doing their level best to keep the fires of hatred burning?   The Chinese, Koreans and Japanese are more than neighbours, they are siblings from a Confucian family. They share so much culturally, from this ancient philosophy with its hierarchical, bureaucratic legacy, to rice-growing, art, architecture, chopsticks, noodles and much more which has been passed down from China over millennia. In turn, China has modelled much of its recent industrial and economic strategy on Japan's post-war manufacturing miracle, and adores contemporary Korean popular culture. Yet still East Asia festers with a mutual animosity which frequently threatens to draw the world into a twenty-first-century war.    In his previous international best-seller,  The Almost Nearly Perfect People , Michael Booth set out to explore the Scandinavian tribes and what they think of each other.    In this new book, which blends popular anthropology, history, politics and travel, the subjects are these Asian tigers that have endured occupation, war and devastation to become among the richest, most developed and powerful societies on Earth.    In this deeply researched, revealing book, he sets off on a journey by car, boat, train and plane through all three countries, ending up in a fourth, Taiwan. Here, he hopes to find a positive story but instead discovers the Taiwanese are not merely in conflict with the Chinese, but they also harbour another, less well-known but still bitter grudge towards an East Asian neighbour.||1 online resource||915|ebook - ebook|01/16/2020|2020-01-16|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781473545823?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I5l0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

His account is the first to be based on hundreds of previously unseen archival documents, from the secret minutes of top party meetings to confidential bank reports. Unfolding with great narrative sweep, this riveting, richly detailed chronicle recasts our understanding of an era that both the regime and foreign admirers celebrate as an economic miracle. In charting four decades of so-called 'Reform and Opening Up' and China's emergence as a world power, Dikötter tells a fascinating tale of contradictions and illusions, of shadow banking, anti-corruption drives and extreme state wealth standing alongside everyday poverty. He examines China's approach to the 2008 financial crash, the country's increasing hostility towards perceived Western interference and its development into a thoroughly entrenched dictatorship - one equipped with a sprawling security apparatus and the most sophisticated surveillance system in the world.

[a] full-throated rallying cry.  - Publishers Weekly  One of Ms. Magazine's most-anticipated feminist books of 2023 An eye-opening firsthand account of the ongoing and trailblazing feminist movement in South Korea-one that the world should be watching.  Since the beginning of the #MeToo movement, tens of thousands of people in South Korea have taken to the street, and many more brave individuals took a stand, to end a decades-long abortion ban and bring down powerful men accused of sexual misconduct-including a popular presidential contender. South Korean feminists know that the revolution has been a long time coming, between battles against its own patriarchal society as well as challenging stereotypes of docile Asian women in the Western imagination. Now, author Hawon Jung will show the rest of the world that these women are no delicate flowers-they are trailblazing flames. Flowers of Fire takes the reader into the trenches of this fight for equality, following along as South Korean activists march on the streets, navigate public and private spaces where spycam porn crimes are rampant, and share tips and tricks with each other as they learn how to protect themselves from harassment and how to push authorities to act. Jung, the former Seoul correspondent for the AFP, draws on her on-the-ground reporting and interviews with many women who became activists and leaders, from the elite prosecutor who ignited the country's #MeToo movement to the young women who led the war against non-consensual photography. Their stories, though long overlooked in the West, mirror realities that women across the world are all too familiar with: threats of defamation lawsuits to silence victims of assault, tech-based sexual abuse, and criminal justice systems where victims' voices are often met with suspicion and abusers' downfalls are met with sympathy. These are the issues at the heart of their #MeToo movement, and South Korean women have fought against them vigorously-and with extraordinary success. In Flowers of Fire, Jung illuminates the strength and tenacity of these women, too often sidelined in global conversations about feminism and gender equality.||1 online resource||305.420952|ebook - ebook|03/07/2023|2023-03-07|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781637742426?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kMxzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Their friendship-between a secular American and a madrasa-trained sheikh-had always seemed unlikely, but now they were frustrated and bewildered by the battles being fought in their names. Both knew that a close look at the Quran would reveal a faith that preached peace and not mass murder; respect for women and not oppression. And so they embarked on a yearlong journey through the controversial text.A journalist who grew up in the Midwest and the Middle East, Power offers her unique vantage point on the Quran's most provocative verses as she debates with Akram at cafes, family gatherings, and packed lecture halls, conversations filled with both good humor and powerful insights. Their story takes them to madrasas in India and pilgrimage sites in Mecca, as they encounter politicians and jihadis, feminist activists and conservative scholars. Armed with a new understanding of each other's worldviews, Power and Akram offer eye-opening perspectives, destroy long-held myths, and reveal startling connections between worlds that have seemed hopelessly divided for far too long.Praise for If the Oceans Were InkA vibrant tale of a friendship....

Unai Emery's final game as Arsenal manager sees the Gunners languishing eighth in the league. Appointed in the dying embers of the Wenger years, Emery's 18 months as Arsenal boss has seen the team and the club go backwards – playing unimaginative, pragmatic football, and recently losing to London rivals Chelsea in the final of the Europa League. Something had to change; a fresh head with fresh ideas. A new leader. This is the story of how Mikel Arteta turned Arsenal into one of the most exciting, innovative and feared teams in the league. From cutting his teeth as an assistant under Pep Guardiola before joining Arsenal in the winter of 2019, through to title contenders years later – including bust-ups, Covid, disappointments, FA Cup wins, fan revolt, and eventually the rise of an extraordinary young team standing on the edge of greatness – this book will be the first of its kind to explore the workings of Arteta's philosophy and how he transformed the club from outsiders to title challengers. With chapters on his tactical innovations, in-game strategies, transfer insight and, of course, an account of the memorable 2022-23 season – Revolution is the story of an extraordinary football ascent and the first draft of Arsenal's new history.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|08/31/2023|2023-08-31|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008646493?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pYOyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Brant Pitre.|The Case for Jesus|Pitre, Brant|Pitre, Brant.|Brant Pitre|Nonfiction., Religion & Spirituality., Electronic books., Electronic book|Religion|This book will prove to be a most effective weapon... against the debunking and skeptical attitudes toward the Gospels that are so prevalent, not only in academe, but also on the street, among young people who, sadly, are leaving the Churches in droves. -- Robert Barron, author of Catholicism  For well over a hundred years now, many scholars have questioned the historical truth of the Gospels, claiming that they were originally anonymous. Others have even argued that Jesus of Nazareth did not think he was God and never claimed to be divine. In The Case for Jesus, Dr. Brant Pitre, the bestselling author of Jesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist, goes back to the sources--the biblical and historical evidence for Christ--in order to answer several key questions, including:    • Were the four      Gospels really anonymous?    • Are the      Gospels folklore? Or are they biographies?   • Were the four      Gospels written too late to be reliable?   • What about the      so-called Lost Gospels, such as Q and the Gospel of Thomas?   • Did Jesus      claim to be God?     • Is Jesus      divine in all four Gospels? Or only in John?   • Did Jesus      fulfill the Jewish prophecies of the Messiah?   • Why was Jesus      crucified?   • What is the      evidence for the Resurrection?  As The Case for Jesus will show, recent discoveries in New Testament scholarship, as well as neglected evidence from ancient manuscripts and the early church fathers, together have the potential to pull the rug out from under a century of skepticism toward the traditional Gospels. Above all, Pitre shows how the divine claims of Jesus of Nazareth can only be understood by putting them in their ancient Jewish context.||1 online resource||232.908|ebook - ebook|02/09/2016|2016-02-02|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780770435493?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i9LvCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Bernanke|Nonfiction., Business., Politics., Monetary policy, United States, Economic policy, Electronic books.|Business & Economics|21st Century Monetary Policy takes readers inside the Federal Reserve, explaining what it does and why.    In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve deployed an extraordinary range of policy tools that helped prevent the collapse of the financial system and the U.S. economy. Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues lent directly to U.S. businesses, purchased trillions of dollars of government securities, pumped dollars into the international financial system, and crafted a new framework for monetary policy that emphasized job creation.   These strategies would have astonished Powell's late-20th-century predecessors, from William McChesney Martin to Alan Greenspan, and the advent of these tools raises new questions about the future landscape of economic policy.   In 21st Century Monetary Policy, Ben S. Bernanke-former chair of the Federal Reserve and one of the world's leading economists-explains the Fed's evolution and speculates on its future. Taking a fresh look at the bank's policymaking over the past seventy years, including his own time as chair, Bernanke shows how changes in the economy have driven the Fed's innovations. He also lays out new challenges confronting the Fed, including the return of inflation, cryptocurrencies, increased risks of financial instability, and threats to its independence.   Beyond explaining the central bank's new policymaking tools, Bernanke also captures the drama of moments when so much hung on the Fed's decisions, as well as the personalities and philosophies of those who led the institution.||1 online resource||332.110973|ebook - ebook|05/17/2022|2022-05-17|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781324020479?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qAJLEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Like many other small cities in this ever-evolving country, Fuling is heading down a new path of change and growth, which came into remarkably sharp focus when Peter Hessler arrived as a Peace Corps volunteer, marking the first time in more than half a century that the city had an American resident. Hessler taught English and American literature at the local college, but it was his students who taught him about the complex processes of understanding that take place when one is immersed in a radically different society.Poignant, thoughtful, funny, and enormously compelling, River Town is an unforgettable portrait of a city that is seeking to understand both what it was and what it someday will be.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|02/27/2024|2010-09-21|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062028983?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mTkAeWjMqHUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Timely... One of the best works on Hitler and the origins of the Third Reich to appear in recent years. -Kirkus ReviewsAn outstanding study... All the huge, and terrible moments of the early Nazi era are dissected...but the real strength of this book is in disentangling the personal story of man and monster. -The Guardian (U.K.) For all the literature about Adolf Hitler there have been just four seminal biographies; this is the fifth, a landmark work that sheds important new light on Hitler himself. Drawing on previously unseen papers and a wealth of recent scholarly research, Volker Ullrich reveals the man behind the public persona, from Hitler's childhood to his failures as a young man in Vienna to his experiences during the First World War to his rise as a far-right party leader. Ullrich deftly captures Hitler's intelligence, instinctive grasp of politics, and gift for oratory as well as his megalomania, deep insecurity, and repulsive worldview. Many previous biographies have focused on the larger social conditions that explain the rise of the Third Reich. Ullrich gives us a comprehensive portrait of a postwar Germany humiliated by defeat, wracked by political crisis, and starved by an economic depression, but his real gift is to show vividly how Hitler used his ruthlessness and political talent to shape the Nazi party and lead it to power. For decades the world has tried to grasp how Hitler was possible.

The idea of the rule of law as the foundation of modern states and civilisations has recently become even more talismanic than that of democracy, but what does it actually consist of?   In this brilliant short book, Britain's former senior law lord, and one of the world's most acute legal minds, examines what the idea actually means. He makes clear that the rule of law is not an arid legal doctrine but is the foundation of a fair and just society, is a guarantee of responsible government, is an important contribution to economic growth and offers the best means yet devised for securing peace and co-operation. He briefly examines the historical origins of the rule, and then advances eight conditions which capture its essence as understood in western democracies today. He also discusses the strains imposed on the rule of law by the threat and experience of international terrorism.   The book will be influential in many different fields and should become a key text for anyone interested in politics, society and the state of our world.||1 online resource||340.11|ebook - ebook|07/07/2011|2011-07-07|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780141962016?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6UsjcX-IUJ4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Michael Wood.|The Story of China|Wood, Michael|Wood, Michael.|Michael Wood|Nonfiction., Civilization., History., China History., China., China Civilization., Electronic books., History.|History|'A learned, wise, wonderfully written single volume history of a civilisation that I knew I should know more about' Tom Holland  'Masterful and engrossing...well-paced, eminently readable and well-timed. A must-read for those who want - and need - to know about the China of yesterday, today and tomorrow' Peter Frankopan   China's story is extraordinarily rich and dramatic. Now Michael Wood, one of the UK's pre-eminent historians, brings it all together in a major new one-volume history of China that is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand its burgeoning role in our world today.   China is the oldest living civilisation on earth, but its history is still surprisingly little known in the wider world. Michael Wood's sparkling narrative, which mingles the grand sweep with local and personal stories, woven together with the author's own travel journals, is an enthralling account of China's 4000-year-old tradition, taking in life stationed on the  Great Wall  or inside the  Forbidden City . The story is enriched with the latest archaeological and documentary discoveries; correspondence and court cases going back to the  Qin and Han dynasties ; family letters from soldiers in the real-life  Terracotta Army ; stories from  Silk Road merchants  and  Buddhist travellers , along with memoirs and diaries of emperors, poets and peasants.     In the modern era, the book is full of new insights, with the electrifying manifestos of the feminist revolutionaries  Qiu Jin  and  He Zhen , extraordinary eye-witness accounts of the  Japanese invasion , the  Great Famine  and the  Cultural Revolution  under  Chairman Mao , and fascinating newly published sources for the great turning points in China's modern history, including the  Tiananmen Square  crisis of 1989, and the new order of  President Xi Jinping .    A compelling portrait of a single civilisation over an immense period of time, the book is full of intimate detail and colourful voices, taking us from the desolate  Mongolian steppes  to the ultra-modern world of  Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong . It also asks what were the forces that have kept China together for so long? Why was China overtaken by the west after the 18th century? What lies behind China's extraordinary rise today?   The Story of China    tells a thrilling story of intense drama, fabulous creativity and deep humanity; a portrait of a country that will be of the greatest importance to the world in the twenty-first century.||1 online resource||951|ebook - ebook|09/03/2020|2020-09-03|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781471176005?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wrueDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Anne Applebaum.|Autocracy, Inc.|Applebaum, Anne|Applebaum, Anne.|Anne Applebaum|Nonfiction., History., Politics., Electronic books.|Political Science|From the Pulitzer-prize winning,  New York Times  bestselling author, an alarming account of how autocracies work together to undermine the democratic world, and how we should organize to defeat them A masterful guide to the new age of authoritarianism... clear-sighted and fearless… a masterclass in the marriage of dodgy government to international criminality… (both) deeply disturbing . ”—John Simpson,  The Guardian •  Especially timely. —The Washington Post   We think we know what an autocratic state looks like: There is an all-powerful leader at the top. He controls the police. The police threaten the people with violence. There are evil collaborators, and maybe some brave dissidents. But in the 21st century, that bears little resemblance to reality. Nowadays, autocracies are underpinned not by one dictator, but by sophisticated networks composed of kleptocratic financial structures, surveillance technologies, and professional propagandists, all of which operate across multiple regimes, from China to Russia to Iran. Corrupt companies in one country do business with corrupt companies in another. The police in one country can arm and train the police in another, and propagandists share resources and themes, pounding home the same messages about the weakness of democracy and the evil of America. International condemnation and economic sanctions cannot move the autocrats. Even popular opposition movements, from Venezuela to Hong Kong to Moscow, don't stand a chance. The members of Autocracy, Inc, aren't linked by a unifying ideology, like communism, but rather a common desire for power, wealth, and impunity. In this urgent treatise, which evokes George Kennan's essay calling for containment of the Soviet Union, Anne Applebaum calls for the democracies to fundamentally reorient their policies to fight a new kind of threat.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|07/23/2024|2024-07-23|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780385549943?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wkbyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Samuel P Huntington.|The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order|Huntington, Samuel P.|Huntington, Samuel P.|Samuel P. Huntington|Nonfiction., History., Politics., Electronic books.|Political Science|The classic study of post-Cold War international relations, more relevant than ever in the post-9/11 world, with a new foreword by Zbigniew Brzezinski.Since its initial publication, The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order has become a classic work of international relations and one of the most influential books ever written about foreign affairs. An insightful and powerful analysis of the forces driving global politics, it is as indispensable to our understanding of American foreign policy today as the day it was published. As former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski says in his new foreword to the book, it has earned a place on the shelf of only about a dozen or so truly enduring works that provide the quintessential insights necessary for a broad understanding of world affairs in our time.  Samuel Huntington explains how clashes between civilizations are the greatest threat to world peace but also how an international order based on civilizations is the best safeguard against war. Events since the publication of the book have proved the wisdom of that analysis. The 9/11 attacks and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have demonstrated the threat of civilizations but have also shown how vital international cross-civilization cooperation is to restoring peace. As ideological distinctions among nations have been replaced by cultural differences, world politics has been reconfigured. Across the globe, new conflicts-and new cooperation-have replaced the old order of the Cold War era.  The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order explains how the population explosion in Muslim countries and the economic rise of East Asia are changing global politics. These developments challenge Western dominance, promote opposition to supposedly universal Western ideals, and intensify intercivilization conflict over such issues as nuclear proliferation, immigration, human rights, and democracy. The Muslim population surge has led to many small wars throughout Eurasia, and the rise of China could lead to a global war of civilizations. Huntington offers a strategy for the West to preserve its unique culture and emphasizes the need for people everywhere to learn to coexist in a complex, multipolar, muliticivilizational world.||1 online resource||909.829|ebook - ebook|05/31/2007|2007-05-31|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781416561248?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LO4xG-bH1CQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

A magisterial account of the money and violence behind the world's most powerful dictatorships. -Washington Post    In this shocking, meticulously reported work of narrative nonfiction, an award-winning investigative journalist exposes capitalism's monster-global kleptocracy-and reveals how it is corrupting the world around us.    They are everywhere, the thieves and their people. Masters of secrecy. Until now we have detected their presence only by what they leave behind. A body in a burned-out Audi. Workers riddled with bullets in the Kazakh Desert. A rigged election in Zimbabwe. A British banker silenced and humiliated for trying to expose the truth about the City of London.  They have amassed more money than most countries. But what they are really stealing is power.  In this real-life thriller packed with jaw-dropping revelations, award-winning investigative journalist Tom Burgis weaves together four stories that reveal a terrifying global web of corruption: the troublemaker from Basingstoke who stumbles on the secrets of a Swiss bank, the ex-Soviet billionaire constructing a private empire, the righteous Canadian lawyer with a mysterious client, and the Brooklyn crook protected by the CIA.  Glimpses of this shadowy world have emerged over the years. In Kleptopia, Burgis connects the dots. He follows the dirty money that is flooding the global economy, emboldening dictators, and poisoning democracies. From the Kremlin to Beijing, Harare to Riyadh, Paris to the White House, the trail shows something even more sinister: the thieves are uniting. And the human cost will be great.||1 online resource||364.1323|ebook - ebook|09/08/2020|2020-09-08|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062883674?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HbmoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

How have the three dominant monotheistic religions-Judaism, Christianity, and Islam-shaped and altered the conception of God? How have these religions influenced each other? In this stunningly intelligent book, Karen Armstrong, one of Britain's foremost commentators on religious affairs, traces the history of how men and women have perceived and experienced God, from the time of Abraham to the present.  The epic story begins with the Jews' gradual transformation of pagan idol worship in Babylon into true monotheism-a concept previously unknown in the world. Christianity and Islam both rose on the foundation of this revolutionary idea, but these religions refashioned 'the One God' to suit the social and political needs of their followers. From classical philosophy and medieval mysticism to the Reformation, Karen Armstrong performs the near miracle of distilling the intellectual history of monotheism into one superbly readable volume, destined to take its place as a classic.

Tania Branigan.|Red Memory|Branigan, Tania|Branigan, Tania.|Tania Branigan|Nonfiction., History., Electronic books.|History|An indelible exploration of the Cultural Revolution and how it shapes China today,    Red Memory    uncovers forty years of silence through the rarely heard stories of individuals who lived through Mao's decade of madness.  'Written with an almost painful beauty.'  JONATHAN FREEDLAND  'Took my breath away.'  BARBARA DEMICK  'Haunting.'  OLIVER BURKEMAN  'A masterpiece.'  JULIA LOVELL   A 13-year-old Red Guard revels in the great adventure, and struggles with her doubts. A silenced composer, facing death, determines to capture the turmoil. An idealistic student becomes the 'corpse master' . . .  More than fifty years on, the Cultural Revolution's scar runs through the heart of Chinese society, and through the souls of its citizens. Stationed in Beijing for the  Guardian , Tania Branigan came to realise that this brutal and turbulent decade continues to propel and shape China to this day. Yet official suppression and personal trauma have conspired in national amnesia: it exists, for the most part, as an absence.  Red Memory  explores the stories of those who are driven to confront the era, fearing or yearning its return. What happens to a society when you can no longer trust those closest to you? What happens to the present when the past is buried, exploited or redrawn? And how do you live with yourself when the worst is over?|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|01/31/2023|2023-01-31|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781783352678?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bWJ9EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In 1848, two young men published what would become one of the defining documents of modern history, The Communist Manifesto. It rapidly realigned political faultlines all over the world and its aftershock resonates to this day. In the many years since its publication, no other social program has inspired such divisive and violent debate. Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the world's first regime to adopt the Manifesto's tenets, historians have debated its intent and its impact. In the current era of market democracy in Russia and Eastern Europe, nationalism on every continent, and an ever tightening global economy, does the specter of Communism still haunt the world?

But what if the China Dream is to replace us, just as America replaced the British Empire, without firing a shot?Based on interviews with Chinese defectors and newly declassified, previously undisclosed national security documents, The Hundred-Year Marathon reveals China's secret strategy to supplant the United States as the world's dominant power, and to do so by 2049, the one-hundredth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. Michael Pillsbury, a fluent Mandarin speaker who has served in senior national security positions in the U.S. government since the days of Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, draws on his decades of contact with the hawks in China's military and intelligence agencies and translates their documents, speeches, and books to show how the teachings of traditional Chinese statecraft underpin their actions. He offers an inside look at how the Chinese really view America and its leaders - as barbarians who will be the architects of their own demise.Pillsbury also explains how the U.S. government has helped - sometimes unwittingly and sometimes deliberately - to make this China Dream come true, and he calls for the United States to implement a new, more competitive strategy toward China as it really is, and not as we might wish it to be. The Hundred-Year Marathon is a wake-up call as we face the greatest national security challenge of the twenty-first century.||1 online resource||327.1120951|ebook - ebook|02/03/2015|2015-02-03|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781627790116?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=grGMAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Asia is returning to the center stage it occupied for eighteen centuries before the rise of the West.By 2050, three of the world’s largest economies will be Asian: China, India, and Japan. In The New Asian Hemisphere, Kishore Mahbubani argues that Western minds need to step outside their “comfort zone” and prepare new mental maps to understand the rise of Asia. The West, he says, must gracefully share power with Asia by giving up its automatic domination of global institutions from the IMF to the World Bank, from the G7 to the UN Security Council. Only then will the new Asian powers reciprocate by becoming responsible stakeholders in a stable world order.||1 online resource||327.5|ebook - ebook|04/28/2009|2009-04-28|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781586486280?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zdw3hyNPj34C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Introduction by Gillian Flynn •   Afterword by Patton Oswalt     A brilliant genre-buster.... Propulsive, can't-stop-now reading.   -Stephen King     For more than ten years, a mysterious and violent predator committed fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before moving south, where he perpetrated ten sadistic murders. Then he disappeared, eluding capture by multiple police forces and some of the best detectives in the area.  Three decades later, Michelle McNamara, a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, was determined to find the violent psychopath she called the Golden State Killer. Michelle pored over police reports, interviewed victims, and embedded herself in the online communities that were as obsessed with the case as she was.  I'll Be Gone in the Dark-the masterpiece McNamara was writing at the time of her sudden death-offers an atmospheric snapshot of a moment in American history and a chilling account of a criminal mastermind and the wreckage he left behind. It is also a portrait of a woman's obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth. Utterly original and compelling, it has been hailed as a modern true crime classic-one which fulfilled Michelle's dream: helping unmask the Golden State Killer."||1 online resource||364.1532098|ebook - ebook|02/27/2018||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062319807?s=MD|

A remarkable piece of investigative journalism into one of the most pervasive and troubling mysteries of recent memory. 01:20am, 8 March 2014. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, carrying 239 passengers, disappeared into the night, never to be seen or heard from again. The incident was inexplicable. In a world defined by advanced technology and interconnectedness, how could an entire aircraft become untraceable? Had the flight been subject to a perfect hijack? Perhaps the pilots lost control? And if the plane did crash, where was the wreckage? Writing for Le Monde in the days and months after the plane's disappearance, journalist Florence de Changy closely documented the chaotic international investigation that followed, uncovering more questions than answers. Riddled with inconsistencies, contradictions and a lack of basic communication between authorities, the mystery surrounding flight MH370 only deepened. Now, de Changy offers her own explanation. Drawing together countless eyewitness testimonies, press releases, independent investigative reports and expert opinion, The Disappearing Act offers an eloquent and deeply unnerving narrative of what happened to the missing aircraft. An incredible feat of investigative journalism and a testament to de Changy's tenacity and resolve, this book is an exhaustive, gripping account into one of the most profound mysteries of the 21st century.||1 online resource||363.12465|ebook - ebook|02/04/2021|2021-02-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008381561?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XpC5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Spies  is the history of the secret war that Russia and the West have been waging for a century. Espionage, sabotage, and subversion were the Kremlin's means to equalize the imbalance of resources between the East and West before, during, and after the Cold War. There was nothing unprecedented about Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. It was simply business as usual, new means used for old ends.   The Cold War started long before 1945. But the West fought back after World War II, mounting its own shadow war, using disinformation, vast intelligence networks, and new technologies against the Soviet Union.  Spies  is an inspiring, engrossing story of the best and worst of mankind: bravery and honor, treachery and betrayal. The narrative shifts across continents and decades, from the freezing streets of St. Petersburg in 1917 to the bloody beaches of Normandy; from coups in faraway lands to present-day Moscow where troll farms, synthetic bots, and weaponized cyber-attacks being launched on the woefully unprepared West. It is about the rise and fall of eastern superpowers: Russia's past and present and the global ascendance of China.   Mining hitherto secret archives in multiple languages, Calder Walton shows that the Cold War started earlier than commonly assumed, that it continued even after the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, and that Britain and America's clandestine struggle with the Soviet government provides key lessons for countering China today. This fresh reading of history, combined with practical takeaways for our current great power struggles, make  Spies  a unique and essential addition to the history of the Cold War and the unrolling conflict between the United States and China that will dominate the 21st century.||1 online resource||327.124709|ebook - ebook|06/06/2023|2023-06-06|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781668000717?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sR6UEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

An essential read'    Financial Times        In the eighteenth century, India's share of the world economy was as large as Europe's. By 1947, after two centuries of British rule, it had decreased six-fold. The Empire blew rebels from cannon, massacred unarmed protesters, entrenched institutionalised racism, and caused millions to die from starvation.  British imperialism justified itself as enlightened despotism for the benefit of the governed, but Shashi Tharoor takes demolishes this position, demonstrating how every supposed imperial 'gift' - from the railways to the rule of law - was designed in Britain's interests alone. He goes on to show how Britain's Industrial Revolution was founded on India's deindustrialisation, and the destruction of its textile industry.  In this bold and incisive reassessment of colonialism, Tharoor exposes to devastating effect the inglorious reality of Britain's stained Indian legacy.||1 online resource||954.030|ebook - ebook|02/01/2018|2018-02-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780241331453?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZWwwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Ramachandra Guha's hugely acclaimed book tells the full story - the pain and the struggle, the humiliations and the glories - of the world's largest and least likely democracy.  While India is sometimes the most exasperating country in the world, it is also the most interesting. Ramachandra Guha writes compellingly of the myriad protests and conflicts that have peppered the history of free India. Moving between history and biography, the story of modern India is peopled with extraordinary characters. Guha gives fresh insights into the lives and public careers of those long-serving Prime Ministers, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. But the book also writes with feeling and sensitivity about lesser-known (though not necessarily less important) Indians - peasants, tribals, women, workers and musicians.  Massively researched and elegantly written,  India After Gandhi  is a remarkable account of India's rebirth, and a work already hailed as a masterpiece of single volume history. This tenth anniversary edition, published to coincide with seventy years of India's independence, is revised and expanded to bring the narrative up to the present.||1 online resource||954.04|ebook - ebook|02/10/2011|2011-02-10|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780330540209?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8FKepYC6wzwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Anderson Cooper.|Vanderbilt|Cooper, Anderson|Cooper, Anderson.|Anderson Cooper, Katherine Howe|Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., History., Electronic books.|Biography & Autobiography|New York Times bestselling author and journalist Anderson Cooper teams with New York Times bestselling historian and novelist Katherine Howe to chronicle the rise and fall of a legendary American dynasty-his mother's family, the Vanderbilts.   When eleven-year-old Cornelius Vanderbilt began to work on his father's small boat ferrying supplies in New York Harbor at the beginning of the nineteenth century, no one could have imagined that one day he would, through ruthlessness, cunning, and a pathological desire for money, build two empires-one in shipping and another in railroads-that would make him the richest man in America. His staggering fortune was fought over by his heirs after his death in 1877, sowing familial discord that would never fully heal. Though his son Billy doubled the money left by the Commodore, subsequent generations competed to find new and ever more extraordinary ways of spending it. By 2018, when the last Vanderbilt was forced out of The Breakers-the seventy-room summer estate in Newport, Rhode Island, that Cornelius's grandson and namesake had built-the family would have been unrecognizable to the tycoon who started it all.  Now, the Commodore's great-great-great-grandson Anderson Cooper, joins with historian Katherine Howe to explore the story of his legendary family and their outsized influence. Cooper and Howe breathe life into the ancestors who built the family's empire, basked in the Commodore's wealth, hosted lavish galas, and became synonymous with unfettered American capitalism and high society. Moving from the hardscrabble wharves of old Manhattan to the lavish drawing rooms of Gilded Age Fifth Avenue, from the ornate summer palaces of Newport to the courts of Europe, and all the way to modern-day New York, Cooper and Howe wryly recount the triumphs and tragedies of an American dynasty unlike any other.  Written with a unique insider's viewpoint, this is a rollicking, quintessentially American history as remarkable as the family it so vividly captures.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|09/21/2021|2021-09-21|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062964649?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I0wQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The story of the Astors is a quintessentially American story-of ambition, invention, destruction, and reinvention.  From 1783, when German immigrant John Jacob Astor first arrived in the United States, until 2009, when Brooke Astor's son, Anthony Marshall, was convicted of defrauding his elderly mother, the Astor name occupied a unique place in American society.  The family fortune, first made by a beaver trapping business that grew into an empire, was then amplified by holdings in Manhattan real estate. Over the ensuing generations, Astors ruled Gilded Age New York society and inserted themselves into political and cultural life, but also suffered the most famous loss on the Titanic, one of many shocking and unexpected twists in the family's story.  In this unconventional, page-turning historical biography, featuring black-and-white and color photographs, #1 New York Times bestselling authors Anderson Cooper and Katherine Howe chronicle the lives of the Astors and explore what the Astor name has come to mean in America-offering a window onto the making of America itself.||1 online resource||974.710|ebook - ebook|09/19/2023|2023-09-19|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062964670?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bzCsEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It examines both the historical and contemporary trajectory of the Palestine solidarity movement in order to glean lessons for today's organizers, and compellingly lays out the argument that, in order to achieve justice in Palestine, the movement has to take up the question of socialism regionally and internationally.

Economics in America  explains in clear terms how the field of economics addresses the most pressing issues of our time—from poverty, retirement, and the minimum wage to the ravages of the nation's uniquely disastrous health care system—and narrates Deaton's account of his experiences as a naturalized US citizen and academic economist. Deaton is witty and pulls no punches. In this incisive, candid, and funny book, he describes the everyday lives of working economists, recounting the triumphs as well as the disasters, and tells the inside story of the Nobel Prize in economics and the journey that led him to Stockholm to receive one. He discusses the ongoing tensions between economics and politics—and the extent to which economics has any content beyond the political prejudices of economists—and reflects on whether economists bear at least some responsibility for the growing despair and rising populism in America. Blending rare personal insights with illuminating perspectives on the social challenges that confront us today, Deaton offers a disarmingly frank critique of his own profession while shining a light on his adopted country's policy accomplishments and failures.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|10/03/2023|2023-10-03|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780691247854?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=guS3EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

First developed in the early twentieth century as a way of exploiting the flows of globalization to defend liberal internationalism, their appeal is that they function as an alternative to war. This view, however, ignores the dark paradox at their core: designed to prevent war, economic sanctions are modeled on devastating techniques of warfare.     Tracing the use of economic sanctions from the blockades of World War I to the policing of colonial empires and the interwar confrontation with fascism, Nicholas Mulder uses extensive archival research in a political, economic, legal, and military history that reveals how a coercive wartime tool was adopted as an instrument of peacekeeping by the League of Nations. This timely study casts an overdue light on why sanctions are widely considered a form of war, and why their unintended consequences are so tremendous.||1 online resource||327.1170904|ebook - ebook|01/01/2022|2022-01-11|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780300262520?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kMhQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Charles Goodhart.|The Great Demographic Reversal|Goodhart, Charles|Goodhart, Charles.|Charles Goodhart, Manoj Pradhan|Nonfiction., Social policy., Macroeconomics., Labor economics., International finance., Economics., Economic policy., Age distribution (Demography), Population aging Economic aspects., Globalization Economic aspects., Business., Electronic books., Pradhan, Manoj Vasant, author.|Business & Economics|This original and panoramic book proposes that the underlying forces of demography and globalisation will shortly reverse three multi-decade global trends - it will raise inflation and interest rates, but lead to a pullback in inequality.  Whatever the future holds, the authors argue, it will be nothing like the past. Deflationary headwinds over the last three decades have been primarily due to an enormous surge in the world's available labour supply, owing to very favourable demographic trends and the entry of China and Eastern Europe into the world's trading system.  This book demonstrates how these demographic trends are on the point of reversing sharply, coinciding with a retreat from globalisation.  The result? Ageing can be expected to raise inflation and interest rates, bringing a slew of problems for an over-indebted world economy, but is also anticipated to increase the share of labour, so that inequality falls.  Covering many social and political factors, as well as those that are more purely macroeconomic, the authors address topics including ageing, dementia, inequality, populism, retirement and debt finance, among others.   This book will be of interest and understandable to anyone with an interest on where the world's economy may be going.||1 online resource||304.620|ebook - ebook|08/08/2020|2020-08-08|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9783030426576?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rEz2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Harl|Nonfiction., History., Politics., Electronic books.|History|An epic history of how the so-called 'barbarians of the steppes' shaped the modern world.       'This is a history of epic scope that brings together the empires of the steppe land with the caravan cities of the Silk Road and imperial China'  Martyn Rady, author of  The Middle Kingdoms   'A sweeping account of forty-five centuries of nomadic tribes'  Gillian Tett,  Financial Times  ' Flips the script to present the booted, felt-capped, leather-trousered and kaftan-wearing nomads as the bearers of civilisation . . . Harl's exhaustively researched book will ensure they rejoin the narrative of world history ' Marc David Baer,  Guardian  The barbarian nomads of the Eurasian steppes played a decisive role in world history, but their achievements have gone largely unnoticed. These tribes produced some of the world's greatest conquerors: Attila the Hun, Genghis Khan and Tamerlane, among others. And their deeds still resonate today.    Indeed, these nomads built long-lasting empires, facilitated the first global trade of the Silk Road and disseminated religions, technology, knowledge and goods of every description that enriched and changed the lives of so many across Europe, China and the Middle East. From a single region emerged a great many peoples – the Huns, the Mongols, the Magyars, the Turks, the Xiongnu, the Scythians, the Goths – all of whom went on to profoundly and irrevocably shape the modern world.    In this enthralling new history, Professor Kenneth W. Harl draws on a lifetime of scholarship to vividly recreate the lives of these peoples from their beginnings to the early modern age. Their brutal struggle to survive on the steppes bred a resilient, pragmatic people ever-ready to learn from their neighbours. In warfare, they dominated the battlefield for over fifteen hundred years. Under charismatic rulers, they could topple empires and win their own.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|08/17/2023|2023-08-17|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781526630445?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WNiVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Sir Mark Sykes was a visionary politician; François Georges-Picot a diplomat with a grudge. The deal they struck, which was designed to relieve tensions that threatened to engulf the Entente Cordiale, drew a line in the sand from the Mediterranean to the Persian frontier. Territory north of that stark line would go to France; land south of it, to Britain. The creation of Britain's 'mandates' of Palestine, Transjordan and Iraq, and France's in Lebanon and Syria, made the two powers uneasy neighbours for the following thirty years.   Through a stellar cast of politicians, diplomats, spies and soldiers, including T. E. Lawrence, Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle, A Line in the Sand vividly tells the story of the short but crucial era when Britain and France ruled the Middle East. It explains exactly how the old antagonism between these two powers inflamed the more familiar modern rivalry between the Arabs and the Jews, and ultimately led to war between the British and French in 1941 and between the Arabs and Jews in 1948.   In 1946, after many years of intrigue and espionage, Britain succeeded in ousting France from Lebanon and Syria, and hoped that, having done so, it would be able to cling on to Palestine. Using newly declassified papers from the British and French archives, James Barr brings this clandestine struggle back to life, and reveals, for the first time, the stunning way in which the French finally got their revenge.||1 online resource||956.02|ebook - ebook|10/27/2011|2011-10-27|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781849839037?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V7r7I9OQ_gIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Little is known, however, about her own spiritual heights or her struggles. This collection of her writing and reflections, almost all of which have never been made public before, sheds light on Mother Teresa's interior life in a way that reveals the depth and intensity of her holiness for the first time.Compiled and presented by Fr. Brian Kolodiejchuk, M.C., who knew Mother Teresa for twenty years and is the postulator for her cause for sainthood and director of the Mother Teresa Center, MOTHER TERESA brings together letters she wrote to her spiritual advisors over decades. A moving chronicle of her spiritual journey--including moments, indeed years, of utter desolation--these letters reveal the secrets she shared only with her closest confidants. She emerges as a classic mystic whose inner life burned with the fire of charity and whose heart was tested and purified by an intense trial of faith, a true dark night of the soul.Published to coincide with the tenth anniversary of her death, MOTHER TERESA is an intimate portrait of a woman whose life and work continue to be admired by millions of people.||1 online resource||271.97|ebook - ebook|09/04/2007|2007-09-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780385524209?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P4cqT0nK_joC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Robert Lighthizer.|No Trade Is Free|Lighthizer, Robert|Lighthizer, Robert.|Robert Lighthizer|Nonfiction., Politics., Electronic books.|Political Science|America is the first country in history to fund the rise of its rivals. We need to stop now, before it's too late.    One of the most consequential U.S. Trade Representatives in our history, Robert Lighthizer led a great reset of American trade policy that has endured across Administrations. For more than 40 years, he litigated, negotiated, and editorialized against the failed policies of one-sided free trade as part of both the Reagan and Trump administrations and as a private lawyer. As Trade Representative, he fought against globalists, importers, lobbyists, foreign governments and big businesses whose interests diverged from those of the American workers.  For decades, unbalanced free trade was the preferred option for the most powerful in Washington, and millions of ordinary Americans paid the price. Instead of prioritizing healthy American communities, good jobs, higher wages, and a promising future for our workers, Washington too often cared more about corporate profits, cheap imports and the concerns of foreign governments, including the Chinese. In return, we got cheaper coffee makers and tee shirts, while thousands of factories closed, wages stagnated, communities deteriorated, economic inequality rose in our country, and we racked up trillions of dollars in trade deficits.  Part memoir, part history, and part policy analysis ,  No Trade is Free tells the story of how America found itself at this point and how the Trump administration took on the orthodoxy of the trade establishment, with astonishing results. With in-depth character sketches of some of the most important leaders of our time—from Donald Trump, to Xi Jinping, to Nancy Pelosi, to Andrés Manuel López Obrador—Lighthizer explains how trade negotiations actually work and why leverage is the key to success—no trade is free.  This book is a wake-up call to our politicians, thought leaders, but most importantly, everyday Americans. It presents the case against the policies that have weakened America and left our families and communities behind. It argues for a worker-focused trade policy. It tells the story of our fight for every American job and how for the first time, a US administration took on China. But most importantly, it is a guide to the new world economy—one which will require a worker-focused trade policy.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|06/27/2023|2023-06-27|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780063282148?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CTaEEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Sven Beckert.|Empire of Cotton|Beckert, Sven|Beckert, Sven.|Sven Beckert|Nonfiction., History., Electronic books.|History|The epic story of the rise and fall of the empire of cotton, its centrality to the world economy, and its making and remaking of global capitalism.     Cotton is so ubiquitous as to be almost invisible, yet understanding its history is key to understanding the origins of modern capitalism. Sven Beckert's rich, fascinating book tells the story of how, in a remarkably brief period, European entrepreneurs and powerful statesmen recast the world's most significant manufacturing industry, combining imperial expansion and slave labor with new machines and wage workers to change the world. Here is the story of how, beginning well before the advent of machine production in the 1780s, these men captured ancient trades and skills in Asia, and combined them with the expropriation of lands in the Americas and the enslavement of African workers to crucially reshape the disparate realms of cotton that had existed for millennia, and how industrial capitalism gave birth to an empire, and how this force transformed the world.   The empire of cotton was, from the beginning, a fulcrum of constant global struggle between slaves and planters, merchants and statesmen, workers and factory owners. Beckert makes clear how these forces ushered in the world of modern capitalism, including the vast wealth and disturbing inequalities that are with us today. The result is a book as unsettling as it is enlightening: a book that brilliantly weaves together the story of cotton with how the present global world came to exist.

Milton Friedman was, alongside John Maynard Keynes, the most influential economist of the twentieth century. His work was instrumental in the turn toward free markets that defined the 1980s, and his full-throated defenses of capitalism and freedom resonated with audiences around the world. It's no wonder the last decades of the twentieth century have been called the Age of Friedman-or that analysts have sought to hold him responsible for both the rising prosperity and the social ills of recent times. In  Milton Friedman , the first full biography to employ archival sources, the historian Jennifer Burns tells Friedman's extraordinary story with the nuance it deserves. She provides lucid and lively context for his groundbreaking work on everything from why dentists earn less than doctors, to the vital importance of the money supply, to inflation and the limits of government planning and stimulus. She traces Friedman's longstanding collaborations with women, including the economist Anna Schwartz, as well as his complex relationships with powerful figures such as Fed Chair Arthur Burns and Treasury Secretary George Shultz, and his direct interventions in policymaking at the highest levels. Most of all, Burns explores Friedman's key role in creating a new economic vision and a modern American conservatism. The result is a revelatory biography of America's first neoliberal-and perhaps its last great conservative."||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|11/14/2023|2023-11-14|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780374601157?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rb2iEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Richard C Koo.||Koo, Richard C.|Koo, Richard C.||Nonfiction., Business., Electronic books.||In  Pursued Economy: Understanding and Overcoming the Challenging New Realities for Advanced Economies , celebrated economist and thought leader Richard C. Koo dives deep into the failure of traditional economic solutions to address the economic and social problems of post-Great Recession and post-pandemic economies. Starting with the original concepts of balance sheet recessions and global competition for capital, the author explains why the Great Recession lasted for so long and why well-intentioned policies that worked so well in the past are no longer working today.  Readers will discover that advanced economies moved from what the author calls the golden era to the pursued era of economic development long ago, but the policy debate in these countries continues to be informed by golden era assumptions that are no longer relevant but are still taught in universities. That mismatch has led to an over-reliance on monetary policy and an under-reliance on fiscal policy that are distorting economies and worsening inequality in a profoundly transformed world.  With many real-world examples from the author's extensive involvement in the policy debate on economic, banking and trade issues in several countries, including the U.S., the book describes the correct policy mix in the pursued era as distinct from that in the golden era. It also explains the challenges central banks face in fighting inflation after a decade of over-reliance on monetary policy that flooded the world's economies with unprecedented liquidity.  Instead of simply assuming the existence of trend growth rates, this book tackles the issue of economic growth head-on so as to elucidate the symmetry between the drivers of growth and the drivers of recession. It also argues that the fundamental disconnect between free trade and free capital movements must be addressed in order to maximize the gains from globalization while minimizing its costs. Written in simple language and with a great sense of urgency,  Pursued Economy  should be of interest to anyone who is concerned about the global economy, financial stability and geopolitics.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|07/22/2022||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781119984283?s=MD|

The Cathay Hotel, located on the city's famous waterfront, is one of the most glamorous in the world. Built by Victor Sassoon-billionaire playboy and scion of the Sassoon dynasty-the hotel hosts a who's who of global celebrities: Noel Coward has written a draft of  Private Lives  in his suite and Charlie Chaplin has entertained his wife-to-be. And a few miles away, Mao and the nascent Communist Party have been plotting revolution.  By the 1930s, the Sassoons had been doing business in China for a century, rivaled in wealth and influence by only one other dynasty-the Kadoories. These two Jewish families, both originally from Baghdad, stood astride Chinese business and politics for more than 175 years, profiting from the Opium Wars; surviving Japanese occupation; courting Chiang Kai-shek; and losing nearly everything as the Communists swept into power. In  The Last Kings of Shanghai,  Jonathan Kaufman tells the remarkable history of how these families participated in an economic boom that opened China to the world, but remained blind to the country's deep inequality and to the political turmoil at their doorsteps. In a story stretching from Baghdad to Hong Kong to Shanghai to London, Kaufman enters the lives and minds of these ambitious men and women to forge a tale of opium smuggling, family rivalry, political intrigue, and survival.  The book lays bare the moral compromises of the Kadoories and the Sassoons-and their exceptional foresight, success, and generosity. At the height of World War II, they joined together to rescue and protect eighteen thousand Jewish refugees fleeing Nazism. Though their stay in China started out as a business opportunity, the country became a home they were reluctant to leave, even on the eve of revolution. The lavish buildings they built and the booming businesses they nurtured continue to define Shanghai and Hong Kong to this day. As the United States confronts China's rise, and China grapples with the pressures of breakneck modernization and global power, the long-hidden odysseys of the Sassoons and the Kadoories hold a key to understanding the present moment.||1 online resource||951.1320411|ebook - ebook|06/02/2020|2020-06-02|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780735224421?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2Vy9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Ben Ehrenreich.|The Way to the Spring|Ehrenreich, Ben|Ehrenreich, Ben.|Ben Ehrenreich|Nonfiction., History., Politics., Religion & Spirituality., Electronic books., Electronic book|Political Science|From an award-winning journalist, a brave and necessary immersion into the everyday struggles of Palestinian life  Over the past three years, American writer Ben Ehrenreich has been traveling to and living in the West Bank, staying with Palestinian families in its largest cities and its smallest villages. Along the way he has written major stories for American outlets, including a remarkable New York Times Magazine cover story. Now comes the powerful new work that has always been his ultimate goal, The Way to the Spring. We are familiar with brave journalists who travel to bleak or war-torn places on a mission to listen and understand, to gather the stories of people suffering from extremes of oppression and want: Katherine Boo, Ryszard Kapuściński, Ted Conover, and Philip Gourevitch among them. Palestine is, by any measure, whatever one's politics, one such place. Ruled by the Israeli military, set upon and harassed constantly by Israeli settlers who admit unapologetically to wanting to drive them from the land, forced to negotiate an ever more elaborate and more suffocating series of fences, checkpoints, and barriers that have sundered home from field, home from home, this is a population whose living conditions are unique, and indeed hard to imagine. In a great act of bravery, empathy and understanding, Ben Ehrenreich, by placing us in the footsteps of ordinary Palestinians and telling their story with surpassing literary power and grace, makes it impossible for us to turn away.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|06/14/2016|2016-06-14|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780698148192?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cvDlCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

A wanderlust-whetting cabinet of curiosities on paper.-  New York Times    Inspiring equal parts wonder and wanderlust,  Atlas Obscura  is a phenomenon of a travel book that shot to the top of bestseller lists when it was first published and changed the way we think about the world, expanding our sense of how strange and marvelous it really is.  This second edition takes readers to even more curious and unusual destinations, with more than 100 new places, dozens and dozens of new photographs, and two very special features: twelve city guides, covering Berlin, Budapest, Buenos Aires, Cairo, London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Moscow, New York City, Paris, Shanghai, and Tokyo. Plus a foldout map with a dream itinerary for the ultimate around-the-world road trip. More a cabinet of curiosities than traditional guidebook,  Atlas Obscura  revels in the unexpected, the overlooked, the bizarre, and the mysterious. Here are natural wonders, like the dazzling glowworm caves in New Zealand, or a baobob tree in South Africa so large it has a pub inside where 15 people can sit and drink comfortably. Architectural marvels, including the M. C. Escher-like stepwells in India. Mind-boggling events, like the Baby-Jumping Festival in Spain-and no, it's not the babies doing the jumping, but masked men dressed as devils who vault over rows of squirming infants.  Every page gets to the very core of why humans want to travel in the first place: to be delighted and disoriented, uprooted from the familiar and amazed by the new. With its compelling descriptions, hundreds of photographs, surprising charts, maps for every region of the world, and new city guides, it is a book you can open anywhere and be transported.

Winston S Churchill.||Churchill, Winston S.|Churchill, Winston S.||Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., History., Military., Electronic books.||It is our immense good fortune that a man who presided over this crisis in history is able to turn the action he lived through into enduring literature. — The New York Times      This book is the first in Winston Churchill's monumental six-volume account of the struggle between the Allied Powers in Europe against Germany and the Axis during World War II. Told from the unique viewpoint of a British prime minister, it is also the story of one nation's heroic role in the fight against tyranny.    Having learned a lesson at Munich they would never forget, the British refused to make peace with Hitler, defying him even after France had fallen and it seemed as though the Nazis were unstoppable. What lends this work its tension and power is Churchill's inclusion of primary source material. We are presented with not only Churchill's retrospective analysis of the war, but also memos, letters, orders, speeches, and telegrams, day-by-day accounts of reactions as the drama intensifies. We listen as strategies and counterstrategies unfold in response to Hitler's conquest of Europe, planned invasion of England, and assault on Russia. Together they give a mesmerizing account of the crucial decisions made as the fate of the world hangs in the balance.    The Gathering Storm  covers the Treaty of Versailles, the rise of Adolf Hitler, the capitulation of Munich, and the entry of Britain into the war. This book makes clear Churchill's feeling that the Second World War was a largely senseless but unavoidable conflict—and shows why Churchill earned the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953, in part because of this awe-inspiring work., Text Difficulty 9 - Text Difficulty 12||1 online resource||940.53|ebook - ebook|09/04/2002||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780795306020?s=MD|

Indonesian history and culture are especially relevant today as the Island nation is an emerging power in the region with a dynamic new leader. It is a land of incredible diversity and unending paradoxes that has a long and rich history stretching back a thousand years and more.Indonesia is the fabled Spice Islands of every school child's dreams-one of the most colorful and fascinating countries in history. These are the islands that Europeans set out on countless voyages of discovery to find and later fought bitterly over in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries.

How Democracies Die comes at exactly the right moment.&#8212;The Washington PostDonald Trump's presidency has raised a question that many of us never thought we'd be asking: Is our democracy in danger? Harvard professors Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt have spent more than twenty years studying the breakdown of democracies in Europe and Latin America, and they believe the answer is yes. Democracy no longer ends with a bang&#8212;in a revolution or military coup&#8212;but with a whimper: the slow, steady weakening of critical institutions, such as the judiciary and the press, and the gradual erosion of long-standing political norms. The good news is that there are several exit ramps on the road to authoritarianism. The bad news is that, by electing Trump, we have already passed the first one.  Drawing on decades of research and a wide range of historical and global examples, from 1930s Europe to contemporary Hungary, Turkey, and Venezuela, to the American South during Jim Crow, Levitsky and Ziblatt show how democracies die&#8212;and how ours can be saved.||1 online resource||321.8|ebook - ebook|01/16/2018|2018-01-16|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781524762957?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iF3ODgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

As China seeks to restore its former status as Asia's preeminent power, the countries of Southeast Asia face an increasingly stark choice: flourish within Beijing's orbit or languish outside of it. Meanwhile, as rival powers including the United States take concerted action to curb Chinese ambitions, the region has emerged as an arena of heated strategic competition.    Drawing on more than a decade of on-the-ground experience, Sebastian Strangio explores the impacts of China's rise on Southeast Asia, the varied ways in which the countries of the region are responding, and what it might mean for the future balance of power in the Indo-Pacific.||1 online resource||327.510|ebook - ebook|09/01/2020|2020-09-22|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780300256253?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2lz0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In this comprehensive exploration of one of the world's most prolonged and tragic conflicts, Pappe uses recently declassified archival material to analyse the motivations and strategies of the generals and politicians - and the decision-making process itself - that laid the foundation of the occupation. From a survey of the legal and bureaucratic infrastructures that were put in place to control the population of over one million Palestinians, to the security mechanisms that vigorously enforced that control, Pappe paints a picture of what is to all intents and purposes the world's largest 'open prison'.||1 online resource||956.9405|ebook - ebook|06/22/2017|2017-06-22|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781780744339?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0hm9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

From the optimizing individual to game theory to price theory, The Cartoon Introduction to Economics is the most digestible, explicable, and humorous 200-page introduction to microeconomics you'll ever read. Bauman has put the comedy into economy at comedy clubs and universities around the country and around the world (his Principles of Economics, Translated is a YouTube cult classic). As an educator at both the university and high school levels, he has learned how to make economics relevant to today's world and today's students. As Google's chief economist, Hal Varian, wrote, You don't need a brand-new economics. You just need to see the really cool stuff, the material they didn't get to when you studied economics. The Cartoon Introduction to Economics is all about integrating the really cool stuff into an overview of the entire discipline of microeconomics, from decision trees to game trees to taxes and thinking at the margin. Rendering the cool stuff fun is the artistry of the illustrator and lauded graphic novelist Klein. Panel by panel, page by page, he puts comics into economics. So if the vertiginous economy or a dour professor's 600-page econ textbook has you desperate for a fun, factual guide to economics, reach for The Cartoon Introduction to Economics and let the collaborative genius of the Klein-Bauman team walk you through an entire introductory microeconomics course.||1 online resource||338.50222|ebook - ebook|01/19/2010|2010-01-19|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781466837928?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=91QTAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Paul Collier.|The Future of Capitalism|Collier, Paul|Collier, Paul.|Paul Collier|Nonfiction., History., Politics., Electronic books.|History|From world-renowned economist Paul Collier, a candid diagnosis of the failures of capitalism and a pragmatic and realistic vision for how we can repair it.Deep new rifts are tearing apart the fabric of the United States and other Western societies: thriving cities versus rural counties, the highly skilled elite versus the less educated, wealthy versus developing countries. As these divides deepen, we have lost the sense of ethical obligation to others that was crucial to the rise of post-war social democracy. So far these rifts have been answered only by the revivalist ideologies of populism and socialism, leading to the seismic upheavals of Trump, Brexit, and the return of the far-right in Germany. We have heard many critiques of capitalism but no one has laid out a realistic way to fix it, until now.In a passionate and polemical book, celebrated economist Paul Collier outlines brilliantly original and ethical ways of healing these rifts-economic, social and cultural-with the cool head of pragmatism, rather than the fervor of ideological revivalism. He reveals how he has personally lived across these three divides, moving from working-class Sheffield to hyper-competitive Oxford, and working between Britain and Africa, and acknowledges some of the failings of his profession.Drawing on his own solutions as well as ideas from some of the world's most distinguished social scientists, he shows us how to save capitalism from itself-and free ourselves from the intellectual baggage of the twentieth century.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|04/16/2024|2018-12-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062748669?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YRZPDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Until the spring of 2001, Enron epitomized the triumph of the New Economy. Feared by rivals, worshipped by investors, Enron seemingly could do no wrong. Its profits rose every year; its stock price surged ever upward; its leaders were hailed as visionaries. Then a young Fortune writer, Bethany McLean, wrote an article posing a simple question - how, exactly, does Enron make its money? Within a year Enron was facing humiliation and bankruptcy, the largest in US history, which caused Americans to lose faith in a system that rewarded top insiders with millions of dollars, while small investors lost everything. It was revealed that Enron was a company whose business was an illusion, an illusion that Wall Street was willing to accept even though they knew what the real truth was.

And we are also familiar with the idea that the United States is an empire, exercising power around the world. But what about the actual territories-the islands, atolls, and archipelagos-this country has governed and inhabited?In How to Hide an Empire, Daniel Immerwahr tells the fascinating story of the United States outside the United States. In crackling, fast-paced prose, he reveals forgotten episodes that cast American history in a new light. We travel to the Guano Islands, where prospectors collected one of the nineteenth century's most valuable commodities, and the Philippines, site of the most destructive event on U.S. soil. In Puerto Rico, Immerwahr shows how U.S. doctors conducted grisly experiments they would never have conducted on the mainland and charts the emergence of independence fighters who would shoot up the U.S. Congress.In the years after World War II, Immerwahr notes, the United States moved away from colonialism. Instead, it put innovations in electronics, transportation, and culture to use, devising a new sort of influence that did not require the control of space. Rich with absorbing vignettes, full of surprises, and driven by an original conception of what empire and globalization mean today, How to Hide an Empire is a major and compulsively readable work of history.||1 online resource||973|ebook - ebook|02/19/2019|2019-02-19|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780374715120?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GYtbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

As people lose their faith in old institutions and elites, radical voices at the margins and the grassroots are disrupting the status quo. This is the time of the outsider – the protester, the populist, the hacker. Some of these outsiders have sown chaos, like Donald Trump, and others have provided inspirational leadership, like Volodymyr Zelensky. But all have grasped this precarious moment to make something new. Writing with a critic's incisive understanding of cultural trends, Michiko Kakutani outlines the consequences of these new asymmetries of power, and looks back to similar hinge moments in history, from the waning of the Middle Ages to the aftermath of the Second World War, to find a way forward. For there is, Kakutani argues, always the promise of transformation in times of turmoil. We can surrender to the waters, give in to the gathering chaos, or we can use the wave's momentum to propel us into a more stable and sustainable future.||1 online resource||909.83|ebook - ebook|03/14/2024||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008706517?s=MD|

When Bill Browder's young Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, was beaten to death in a Moscow jail, Browder made it his life's mission to go after his killers and make sure they faced justice. The first step of that mission was to uncover who was behind the $230 million tax refund scheme that Magnitsky was killed over. As Browder and his team tracked the money as it flowed out of Russia through the Baltics and Cyprus and on to Western Europe and the Americas, they were shocked to discovered that Vladimir Putin himself was a beneficiary of the crime. As law enforcement agencies began freezing the money, Putin retaliated. He and his cronies set up honey traps, hired process servers to chase Browder through cities, murdered more of his Russian allies, and enlisted some of the top lawyers and politicians in America to bring him down. Putin will stop at nothing to protect his money. As  Freezing Order  reveals, it was Browder's campaign to expose Putin's corruption that prompted Russia's intervention in the 2016 US presidential election.  At once a financial caper, an international adventure and a passionate plea for justice , Freezing Order  is a timely and stirring morality tale about how one man can take on one of the most ruthless villains in the world.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|04/12/2022|2022-04-12|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781398506091?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WvBbEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Department of the Treasury., Nonfiction., Dollar, American., Economic history., Business., United States Economic conditions., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|Incisive debut treatise... Mohsin brings to the proceedings a reporter's eye for story - Publisher's Weekly From  Bloomberg News  reporter Saleha Mohsin, the untold story of how one of America's most invincible institutions-the Treasury-has used the U.S. dollar to define America's role in the world, and our economic future.  In 1995, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin re-defined the next thirty years of currency policy with the mantra, A strong dollar is in America's interest. That mantra held, ushering in exceptional prosperity and cheap foreign goods, but the strong dollar policy also played a role in the devastating hollowing out of America's manufacturing sector. Meanwhile, abroad, the United States increasingly turned to the dollar as a weapon of war. In  Paper Soldiers , Saleha Mohsin reveals how the Treasury Department has shaped U.S. policy at home and overseas by wielding the American dollar as a weapon-and what that means in a new age of crisis. For decades, America has preferred its currency superpower-strong, the basis of a strong dollar policy that attracted foreign investors and pleased consumers. Drawing on Mohsin's unparalleled access to current and former Treasury officials like Robert Rubin, Steven Mnuchin, and Janet Yellen,  Paper Soldiers  traces that policy's intended and unintended consequences, including the rise of populist sentiment and trade war with China-culminating in an unprecedented attack on the dollar's pristine status during the Trump presidency-and connects the dollar's weaponization from 9/11 to the deployment of crippling financial sanctions against Russia. Ultimately, Mohsin argues that, untethered from many of the economic assumptions of the last generation, the power and influence of the American dollar is now at stake. With first-hand reporting and fresh analysis that illustrates the vast, often unappreciated power that the Treasury Department wields at home and abroad,  Paper Soldiers  tells the inside story of how we really got here-and the future not only of the almighty dollar, but the nation's teetering role as a democratic superpower.||1 online resource||352.40973|ebook - ebook|03/19/2024|2024-03-19|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593539125?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=thTGEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Germany's dreaded Panzer tanks follow - the spearhead of Operation Barbarossa, Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union. With 3.7 million soldiers, it's the largest invasion to date.

It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood. So begins the luminous memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy-exasperating, irresponsible, and beguiling-does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors-yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance, and remarkable forgiveness. Angela's Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic., Text Difficulty 4, UG/Upper grades (9th-12), 5.9 ATOS Level||1 online resource||929.2089916|ebook - ebook|12/17/1998|1998-12-17|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780684864839?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hG4-QGmD_84C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

When the government of Jordan granted amnesty to a group of political prisoners in 1999, it little realized that among them was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a terrorist mastermind and soon the architect of an Islamist movement bent on dominating the Middle East. In  Black Flags,  an unprecedented character-driven account of the rise of ISIS, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Joby Warrick shows how the zeal of this one man and the strategic mistakes of Presidents Bush and Obama led to the banner of ISIS being raised over huge swaths of Syria and Iraq.  Zarqawi began by directing terror attacks from a base in northern Iraq, but it was the American invasion in 2003 that catapulted him to the head of a vast insurgency. By falsely identifying him as the link between Saddam and bin Laden, U.S. officials inadvertently spurred like-minded radicals to rally to his cause. Their wave of brutal beheadings and suicide bombings persisted until American and Jordanian intelligence discovered clues that led to a lethal airstrike on Zarqawi's hideout in 2006.  His movement, however, endured. First calling themselves al-Qaeda in Iraq, then Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, his followers sought refuge in unstable, ungoverned pockets on the Iraq-Syria border. When the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, and as the U.S. largely stood by, ISIS seized its chance to pursue Zarqawi's dream of an ultra-conservative Islamic caliphate.  Drawing on unique high-level access to CIA and Jordanian sources, Warrick weaves gripping, moment-by-moment operational details with the perspectives of diplomats and spies, generals and heads of state, many of whom foresaw a menace worse than al Qaeda and tried desperately to stop it.  Black Flags  is a brilliant and definitive history that reveals the long arc of today's most dangerous extremist threat.

Drawing on a wide range of examples, from the expanding drone assassination program to the threat of nuclear warfare, as well as the flashpoints of Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and Israel/Palestine, he offers unexpected and nuanced insights into the workings of imperial power on our increasingly chaotic planet. In the process, Chomsky provides a brilliant anatomy of just how U.S. elites have grown ever more insulated from any democratic constraints on their power. While the broader population is lulled into apathy-diverted to consumerism or hatred of the vulnerable-the corporations and the rich have increasingly been allowed to do as they please.  Fierce, unsparing, and meticulously documented, Who Rules the World? delivers the indispensable understanding of the central conflicts and dangers of our time that we have come to expect from Chomsky.||1 online resource||327.730|ebook - ebook|05/10/2016|2016-05-10|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781627793827?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1bpcCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The truth is scarier: it's working exactly as designed. In this book, journalist Ezra Klein reveals how that system is polarizing us-and how we are polarizing it-with disastrous results.   The American political system-which includes everyone from voters to journalists to the president-is full of rational actors making rational decisions given the incentives they face, writes political analyst Ezra Klein. We are a collection of functional parts whose efforts combine into a dysfunctional whole.   In  Why We're Polarized , Klein reveals the structural and psychological forces behind America's descent into division and dysfunction. Neither a polemic nor a lament, this book offers a clear framework for understanding everything from Trump's rise to the Democratic Party's leftward shift to the politicization of everyday culture.   America is polarized, first and foremost, by identity. Everyone engaged in American politics is engaged, at some level, in identity politics. Over the past fifty years in America, our partisan identities have merged with our racial, religious, geographic, ideological, and cultural identities. These merged identities have attained a weight that is breaking much in our politics and tearing at the bonds that hold this country together.   Klein shows how and why American politics polarized around identity in the twentieth century, and what that polarization did to the way we see the world and one another. And he traces the feedback loops between polarized political identities and polarized political institutions that are driving our system toward crisis.   This is a revelatory book that will change how you look at politics, and perhaps at yourself.||1 online resource||306.20973|ebook - ebook|01/28/2020|2020-01-28|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781476700397?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1G6gDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

He is her target number eleven, a member of the drug cartel that has terrorized and controlled what was once Miriam's quiet hometown of San Fernando, Mexico, almost one hundred miles from the U.S. border. Having dyed her hair red as a disguise, Miriam watches, waits, and then orchestrates the arrest of this man, exacting her own version of justice. Woven into this deeply researched, moving account is the story of how cartels built their power in Mexico, escalated the use of violence, and kidnapped and murdered tens of thousands. Karen was just one of the many people who disappeared, and Miriam, a brilliant, strategic, and fearless woman, begged for help from the authorities and paid ransom money she could not afford in hopes of saving her daughter. When that failed, she decided that fear is just a word, and began a crusade to track down Karen's killers and to help other victimized families in their search for justice. What do people do when their country and the peaceful town where they have grown up become unrecognizable, suddenly places of violence and fear? Azam Ahmed takes us into the grieving of a country and a family to tell the mesmerizing story of a brave and brilliant woman determined to find out what happened to her daughter, and to see that the criminals who murdered her were punished.  Fear Is Just a Word  is an unforgettable and moving portrait of a woman, a town, and a country, and of what can happen when violent forces leave people to seek justice on their own.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|09/26/2023|2023-09-26|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593448427?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VTmkEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The book reads like a novel, and even though everyone (hopefully) knows how the war ultimately ended, he keeps the reader turning the pages with his gripping prose' NPR A startling, gripping portrait of what it was like to be alive in Britain during the Blitz, and what it was like to be around Churchill. On Winston Churchill's first day as prime minister, Hitler invaded Holland and Belgium. Poland and Czechoslovakia had already fallen, and the Dunkirk evacuation was just two weeks away. For the next twelve months, the Nazis would wage a relentless bombing campaign, killing 45,000 Britons and destroying two million homes. In The Splendid and the Vile, Erik Larson gives a new and brilliantly cinematic account of how Britain's most iconic leader set about unifying the nation at its most vulnerable moment, and teaching 'the art of being fearless.' Drawing on once-secret intelligence reports and diaries, #1 bestselling author Larson takes readers from the shelled streets of London to Churchill's own chambers, giving a vivid vision of true leadership, when - in the face of unrelenting horror - a leader of eloquence, strategic brilliance and perseverance bound a country, and a family, together.||1 online resource||940.542121|ebook - ebook|03/03/2020|2020-03-03|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008274955?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2G-uDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In his devastatingly barbarous colonization of this area, Leopold stole its rubber and ivory, pummelled its people and set up a ruthless regime that would reduce the population by half. . While he did all this, he carefully constructed an image of himself as a deeply feeling humanitarian.  Winner of the Duff Cooper Prize in 1999,  King Leopold's Ghost  is the true and haunting account of this man's brutal regime and its lasting effect on a ruined nation. It is also the inspiring and deeply moving account of a handful of missionaries and other idealists who travelled to Africa and unwittingly found themselves in the middle of a gruesome holocaust.

Anthony Lukas Book Prize and the Dayton Literary Peace PrizeFINALIST for the Ridenhour Book Prize • Chautauqua Prize • William Saroyan International Prize for Writing • PEN Center USA Literary Award NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BYThe EconomistThe Washington PostAmerican Library Association • Kirkus ReviewsA poignant and complex picture of the second atomic bomb's enduring physical and psychological tolls. Eyewitness accounts are visceral and haunting. . . . But the book's biggest achievement is its treatment of the aftershocks in the decades since 1945. —The New YorkerA powerful and unflinching account of the enduring impact of nuclear war, told through the stories of those who survived. On August 9, 1945, three days after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, the United States dropped a second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, a small port city on Japan's southernmost island. An estimated 74,000 people died within the first five months, and another 75,000 were injured.Published on the seventieth anniversary of the bombing, Nagasaki takes readers from the morning of the bombing to the city today, telling the first-hand experiences of five survivors, all of whom were teenagers at the time of the devastation. Susan Southard has spent years interviewing hibakusha (bomb-affected people) and researching the physical, emotional, and social challenges of post-atomic life. She weaves together dramatic eyewitness accounts with searing analysis of the policies of censorship and denial that colored much of what was reported about the bombing both in the United States and Japan. A gripping narrative of human resilience, Nagasaki will help shape public discussion and debate over one of the most controversial wartime acts in history.From the Hardcover edition.||1 online resource||940.548252|ebook - ebook|07/28/2015|2015-07-28|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780698195554?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IgobBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Charles Wheelan.|Naked Money: A Revealing Look at Our Financial System|Wheelan, Charles|Wheelan, Charles.|Charles Wheelan|Nonfiction., Business., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|Charles Wheelan's wonderfully whimsical, best-selling Naked series tackles the weird, surprisingly colorful world of money and banking.    Consider the $20 bill.   It has no more value, as a simple slip of paper, than Monopoly money. Yet even children recognize that tearing one into small pieces is an act of inconceivable stupidity. What makes a $20 bill actually worth twenty dollars? In the third volume of his best-selling Naked series, Charles Wheelan uses this seemingly simple question to open the door to the surprisingly colorful world of money and banking.   The search for an answer triggers countless other questions along the way: Why does paper money (fiat currency if you want to be fancy) even exist? And why do some nations, like Zimbabwe in the 1990s, print so much of it that it becomes more valuable as toilet paper than as currency? How do central banks use the power of money creation to stop financial crises? Why does most of Europe share a common currency, and why has that arrangement caused so much trouble? And will payment apps, bitcoin, or other new technologies render all of this moot?   In Naked Money, Wheelan tackles all of the above and more, showing us how our banking and monetary systems should work in ideal situations and revealing the havoc and suffering caused in real situations by inflation, deflation, illiquidity, and other monetary effects. Throughout, Wheelan's uniquely bright-eyed, whimsical style brings levity and clarity to a subject often devoid of both. With illuminating stories from Argentina, Zimbabwe, North Korea, America, China, and elsewhere around the globe, Wheelan demystifies the curious world behind the paper in our wallets and the digits in our bank accounts.||1 online resource||332.4|ebook - ebook|03/10/2016|2016-04-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780393292893?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=12suCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Walsh, PhD.||Walsh, William J.|Walsh, William||Nonfiction., Mental illness Diet therapy., Mental illness Alternative treatment., Health & Fitness., Medical., Electronic books.||Psychiatry has made great advances in the past fifty years but needs a new direction. Today's emphasis on psychiatric drugs will not stand the test of time. Recent advances in epigenetics and the molecular biology of the brain have provided a roadmap for the development of effective, natural, drug-free therapies that do not produce serious side effects. Psychiatric medications have served society well over the last fifty years, but the need for drug therapies will fade away as science advances. Nutrient Power presents a science-based nutrient therapy system that can help millions of people diagnosed with mental disorders. This approach recognizes that nutrient imbalances can alter brain levels of key neurotransmitters, disrupt gene expression of proteins and enzymes, and cripple the body's protection against environmental toxins. The author's database containing millions of chemical factors in blood, urine, and tissues has identified brain-changing nutrient imbalances in patients diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, behavior disorders, depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. This book describes individualized nutrient therapy treatments that have produced thousands of reports of recovery. Walsh's approach is more scientific than the trial-and-error use of psychiatric drugs and is aimed at a true normalization of the brain. Depression, schizophrenia, and ADHD are umbrella terms that encompass disorders with widely differing brain chemistries and symptoms. Nutrient Power describes nutrient therapies tailored to specific types. Other book highlights include the Walsh Theory of Schizophrenia, a new way to look at autism, a promising new treatment for Alzheimer's, and recommendations for reducing crime and violence.||1 online resource||616.89|ebook - ebook|05/06/2014||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781628739879?s=MD|

Asking for a raise. Nailing the big presentation. Of the 2,000 hours you work every year, your success or failure is determined in the couple of dozen crucial hours when you need to bring your absolute best. Will you?The last few minutes before a major challenge can be terrifying. Ever wished you knew how to make sure you ace the make-or-break test, audition, or interview?We often feel the most powerless just before we're expected to act powerful. As you'll learn in this life-changing book, practice might make perfect, but perfection is useless if you can't summon it when it counts. Pulling off a great speech or the pivotal at bat also requires the right kind of mental preparation.In Psyched Up, journalist Daniel McGinn dives into the latest psychological research and interviews athletes, soldiers, entertainers, and others who, despite years of practice and enviable track records, will ultimately be judged on their ability to delivera solid performance when it's their turn to shine. For instance, he reveals...• How Jerry Seinfeld's jacket and Stephen Colbert's pen help them get laughs.• What General Stanley McChrystal said to Special Forces before they entered the battlefield.• Why the New England Patriots hired the DJ from the Red Sox to help them win.Among other counterintuitive insights, McGinn reveals why trying to calm your backstage jitters can be worse for your performance than channeling it into excitement; how meaningless rituals can do more to prepare you in the final moments than last-minute rehearsal; and how a prescription from your doctor could help you unleash your best skills.Whether you're a sportsperson or a salesperson, an actor or an entrepreneur, one bad hour can throw away months of hard work. There's so much conflicting popular advice that we often end up doing the wrong things. McGinn separates the facts from the old wives' tales and shares new, research driven strategies for activating your talent, optimizing your emotions, and getting psyched up to take the spotlight.||1 online resource||158.1|ebook - ebook|06/06/2017||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780698409392?s=MD|

In 1947, none of the three major race of Malaya - Malays, Chinese, and Indians - regarded themselves as pan-ethnic Malayans with common duties and problems. With the occupation forcibly cut them off from China, Chinese residents began to look inwards towards Malaya and stake political claims, leading inevitably to a political contest with the Malays. As the country advanced towards nationhood and self-government, there was tension between traditional loyalties to the Malay rulers and the states, or to ancestral homelands elsewhere, and the need to cultivate an enduring loyalty to Malaya on the part of those who would make their home there in future. As Japanese forces withdrew from the countryside, the Chinese guerrillas of the communist-led resistance movement, the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA), emerged from the jungle and took control of some 70 per cent of the country's smaller towns and villages, seriously alarming the Malay population. When the British Military Administration sought to regain control of these liberated areas, the ensuing conflict set the tone for future political conflicts and marked a crucial stage in the history of Malaya. Based on extensive archival research, Red Star Over Malaya provides a riveting account of the way the Japanese occupation reshaped colonial Malaya, and of the tension-filled months that followed Japan's surrender. This book is fundamental to an understanding of social and political developments in Malaysia during the second half of the 20th century.||1 online resource||959.5103|ebook - ebook|07/15/2013|2013-07-15|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9789971697365?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iBpqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not likely to make humans redundant. Nor will it create superintelligence anytime soon. But it will make huge advances in the next two decades, revolutionize medicine, entertainment, and transport, transform jobs and markets, and vastly increase the amount of information that governments and companies have about individuals.   AI for Good  leads off with economist and best-selling author Daron Acemoglu, who argues that there are reasons to be concerned about these developments. AI research today pays too much attention to the technological hurtles ahead without enough attention to its disruptive effects on the fabric of society: displacing workers while failing to create new opportunities for them and threatening to undermine democratic governance itself.  But the direction of AI development is not preordained. Acemoglu argues for its potential to create shared prosperity and bolster democratic freedoms. But directing it to that task will take great effort: It will require new funding and regulation, new norms and priorities for developers themselves, and regulations over new technologies and their applications. At the intersection of technology and economic justice, this book will bring together experts-economists, legal scholars, policy makers, and developers-to debate these challenges and consider what steps tech companies can do take to ensure the advancement of AI does not further diminish economic prospects of the most vulnerable groups of population.||1 online resource||338.064|ebook - ebook|05/25/2021|2021-05-25|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781946511638?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HBb6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

But it will make huge advances in the next two decades, revolutionize medicine, entertainment, and transport, transform jobs and markets, and vastly increase the amount of information that governments and companies have about individuals.   AI for Good  leads off with economist and best-selling author Daron Acemoglu, who argues that there are reasons to be concerned about these developments. AI research today pays too much attention to the technological hurtles ahead without enough attention to its disruptive effects on the fabric of society: displacing workers while failing to create new opportunities for them and threatening to undermine democratic governance itself.  But the direction of AI development is not preordained. Acemoglu argues for its potential to create shared prosperity and bolster democratic freedoms. But directing it to that task will take great effort: It will require new funding and regulation, new norms and priorities for developers themselves, and regulations over new technologies and their applications. At the intersection of technology and economic justice, this book will bring together experts-economists, legal scholars, policy makers, and developers-to debate these challenges and consider what steps tech companies can do take to ensure the advancement of AI does not further diminish economic prospects of the most vulnerable groups of population.||1 online resource||006.3|ebook - ebook|05/25/2021|2021-05-25|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781946511638?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HBb6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Great Railway Bazaar   In 1973, Paul Theroux embarked on his now-legendary journey from the United Kingdom through Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Asia's fabled trains-the Orient Express, the Khyber Pass Local, the Frontier Mail, the Golden Arrow to Kuala Lumpur, the Mandalay Express, the Trans-Siberian Express-are the stars of a journey that takes Theroux on a loop eastbound from London's Victoria Station to Tokyo Central, then back from Japan on the Trans-Siberian.    The Old Patagonia Express   Starting with a rush-hour subway ride to South Station in Boston to catch the Lake Shore Limited to Chicago, Paul Theroux takes a grand railway adventure first across the United States and then south through Mexico, Central America, and across the Andes until he winds up on the meandering Old Patagonian Express steam engine.    Ghost Train to the Eastern Star   Thirty years after the epic journey chronicled in The Great Railway Bazaar, Paul Theroux retraces his 25,000-mile journey to witness and experience a landscape drastically transformed by the intervening decades. The Soviet Union has collapsed and China has risen; India booms while Burma smothers under dictatorship; Vietnam flourishes in the aftermath of the havoc America was unleashing on it the last time Theroux passed through.|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|06/11/2020|2018-06-19|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780358003977?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OLPqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Sherman.|Smart Startups|Daniels, Catalina|Daniels, Catalina|Catalina Daniels, James H. Sherman|Nonfiction., Strategic planning., New business enterprises., Creative ability in business., Strategic planning., Creative ability in business., New business enterprises., Business., Electronic books., Handbooks and manuals.|Business & Economics|Two startup company founders and angel investors go inside eighteen companies founded by Harvard Business School graduates, uncovering surprising lessons for success and unexpected pitfalls essential for aspiring entrepreneurs.    Conventional wisdom holds that the most successful entrepreneurs in the world are born with a genius for starting companies, experience one lightning-bolt moment of inspiration after another, follow a tried-and-true process to scale to a billion dollars, and attract deep-pocketed investors at every turn.  The real story is a bit more unconventional-and much more interesting.  Would-be-entrepreneurs Catalina Daniels and James Sherman, hungry to study and apply the best practices of startups to their own ventures, studied the nuts-and-bolts of entrepreneurship as classmates at Harvard Business School. Years later, after successfully founding and exiting several companies, and as angel investors in start-ups, they were surprised to realize that their experiences greatly differed from what they had been taught in school. HBS provided a world-class education in the basics. But there was so much they learned the hard way-working in the trenches-that, looking back, they wished they'd known before starting up.  Inspired, Daniels and Sherman interviewed eighteen HBS graduates and entrepreneurs about their experiences founding companies such as Blue Apron, Rent the Runway, Gilt, and AdoreMe, probing them about what they discovered along the way and what they wish they had known beforehand. The authors bring these insights to life by showcasing the founders in their own words and giving readers the experience of chatting with these remarkable entrepreneurs over a cup of coffee No other book has unearthed advice from so many HBS entrepreneurs. The result is wisdom that challenges assumptions, destroys preconceived notions, crystalizes hunches, and articulates perceptions with a depth possessed by few people in the world.  Starting a business is hard. Seventy percent of startups today fail after their seed round, and less than ten percent achieve success for founders and investors. Faced with such a daunting threshold, aspiring entrepreneurs need all the advice, wisdom, and inspiration they can get. Smart Startups is written for them-a timeless record of essential knowledge that can help them avoid failure and achieve success.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|10/10/2023|2023-10-10|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780063316331?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sgmlEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

A more intimate picture of the dictator’s thinking about world politics, local power and his relationship to the United States than has been seen before.” — The    New York Times  “Another triumph from one of our best journalists.”  —  The Washington Post   Voluminously researched and compulsively readable.  — Air Mail   From bestselling and Pulitzer Prize–winning author Steve Coll, the definitive story of the decades-long relationship between the United States and Saddam Hussein, and a deeply researched and news-breaking investigation into how human error, cultural miscommunication, and hubris led to one of the costliest geopolitical conflicts of our time  When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, its message was clear: Iraq, under the control of strongman Saddam Hussein, possessed weapons of mass destruction that, if left unchecked, posed grave danger to the world. But when no WMDs were found, the United States and its allies were forced to examine the political and intelligence failures that had led to the invasion and the occupation, and the civil war that followed. One integral question has remained unsolved: Why had Saddam seemingly sacrificed his long reign in power by giving the false impression that he had hidden stocks of dangerous weapons?      The Achilles Trap  masterfully untangles the people, ploys of power, and geopolitics that led to America’s disastrous war with Iraq and, for the first time, details America’s fundamental miscalculations during its decades-long relationship with Saddam Hussein. Beginning with Saddam’s rise to power in 1979 and the birth of Iraq’s secret nuclear weapons program, Steve Coll traces Saddam’s motives by way of his inner circle. He brings to life the diplomats, scientists, family members, and generals who had no choice but to defer to their leader—a leader directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, as well as the torture or imprisonment of hundreds of thousands more. This was a man whose reasoning was impossible to reduce to a simple explanation, and the CIA and successive presidential administrations failed to grasp critical nuances of his paranoia, resentments, and inconsistencies—even when the stakes were incredibly high. Calling on unpublished and underreported sources, interviews with surviving participants, and Saddam’s own transcripts and audio files, Coll pulls together an incredibly comprehensive portrait of a man who was convinced the world was out to get him and acted accordingly. A work of great historical significance,  The Achilles Trap  is the definitive account of how corruptions of power, lies of diplomacy, and vanity—on both sides—led to avoidable errors of statecraft, ones that would enact immeasurable human suffering and forever change the political landscape as we know it.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|02/27/2024|2024-02-27|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780525562276?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3JzDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Far from being a recent phenomenon, however, the practice of self-improvement has a long and rich history, extending all the way back to ancient China. For millennia, philosophers, sages, and theologians have reflected on the good life and devised strategies on how to achieve it.     Focusing on ten core ideas of self-improvement that run through the world's advice literature, Anna Katharina Schaffner reveals the ways they have evolved across cultures and historical eras, and why they continue to resonate with us today. Reminding us that there is much to learn from looking at time-honed models, Schaffner also examines the ways that self-improvement practices provide powerful barometers of the values, anxieties, and aspirations that preoccupy us at particular moments in time and expose basic assumptions about our purpose and nature.||1 online resource||170.44|ebook - ebook|09/01/2021|2021-09-14|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780300262391?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oiQ7EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Anderson is a storyteller, feminist, and speaker who views the world through the lens of curiosity and fascination. As a mother-daughter relationship expert, she gently guides readers through revealing painful patterns in their relationships to finding ultimate healing. Her book isn't a quick fix.

Greene uses these questions to guide us toward modern science's new and deeper understanding of the universe. From Newton's unchanging realm in which space and time are absolute, to Einstein's fluid conception of spacetime, to quantum mechanics' entangled arena where vastly distant objects can bridge their spatial separation to instantaneously coordinate their behavior or even undergo teleportation, Greene reveals our world to be very different from what common experience leads us to believe.

Just about everyone thinks they know how they got there. Just about everyone is wrong.  For all that's been written about the Four over the last two decades, no one has captured their power and staggering success as insightfully as Scott Galloway. Instead of buying the myths these companies broadcast, Galloway asks fundamental questions: - How did the Four infiltrate our lives so completely that they're almost impossible to avoid (or boycott)?  - Why does the stock market forgive them for sins that would destroy other firms?  - And as they race to become the world's first trillion-dollar company, can anyone challenge them?  In the same irreverent style that has made him one of the world's most celebrated business professors, Galloway deconstructs the strategies of the Four that lurk beneath their shiny veneers. He shows how they manipulate the fundamental emotional needs that have driven us since our ancestors lived in caves, at a speed and scope others can't match. And he reveals how you can apply the lessons of their ascent to your own business or career.  Whether you want to compete with them, do business with them, or simply live in the world they dominate, you need to understand the Four.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|10/05/2017|2017-10-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781473542105?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_eTACwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

When Harvard-trained physician Dr. Annie Brewster was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2001, she realized firsthand that the medical system to which she'd devoted her entire career was failing patients. The experience was dehumanizing. Her doctors weren't listening. And the confusion, fear, and shame she felt around her diagnosis was preventing her from truly healing, claiming her story, and living her fullest, richest life.  The fact is, doctors can give you a life-changing diagnosis, but they're not equipped to help you deal with the inner fallout: the confusion, anxiety, trauma, and dread that comes after I have some bad news. Here, Dr. Brewster shows how writing your own unique healing story can help you process what comes next-to come to terms, create new ways to thrive, and even reclaim your personal power amid fear, change, and uncertainty.   Dr. Brewster and journalist Rachel Zimmerman each share their own personal stories, acting as expert guides as you move forward on your healing journey. With exercises, reflections, writing prompts, and stories from other real patients, Dr. Brewster and Zimmerman show how you can:       • Process the difficult emotions that come with life-changing diagnosis     • Move beyond being the hero of your own story to become the author of your own story     • Craft your narrative and share it in whatever medium speaks to you: music, audio, art, or writing     • Integrate a traumatic health event into a new and evolving identity     • Use applied storytelling techniques to strengthen connections between you and your loved ones (and even your care providers)     • Cultivate resilience to move forward amid uncertainty and fear||1 online resource||616.89165|ebook - ebook|02/01/2022|2022-02-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781623176709?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G2osEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Posamentier, Robert Geretschläger, Charles Li, Christian Spreitzer|Nonfiction., Mathematics, Mathematics., Electronic books.|Mathematics|Wouldn't it be great if all school teachers (from kindergarten through high school) would share the joy of mathematics with their students, rather than focus only on the prescribed curriculum that will subsequently be tested? This book reveals some of the wonders of mathematics that are often missing from classrooms. Here's your chance to catch up with the math gems you may have missed.  Using jargon-free language and many illustrations, the authors-all veteran math educators-explore five areas-arithmetic, algebra, geometry, probability, and the ways in which mathematics can reinforce common sense. Among other things, you'll learn the rule of 72, which enables you to quickly determine how long it will take your bank account to double its value at a specific interest rate. Other handy techniques include an automatic algorithm for multiplying numbers mentally and a clever application that will allow you to convert from miles to kilometers (or the reverse) mentally. A delightful presentation of geometric novelties reveals relationships that could have made your study of geometry more fun and enlightening. In the area of probability there is a host of interesting examples: from the famous Monty-Hall problem to the counterintuitive probability of two people having the same birthday in a crowded room.  Finally, the authors demonstrate how math will make you a better thinker by improving your organizing abilities and providing useful and surprising solutions to common mathematics problems. You'll come away with an appreciation for math you never thought possible and a true appreciation for this queen of the sciences.||1 online resource||510|ebook - ebook|06/28/2019|2017-08-22|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781633882980?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yM2XDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Although Professor Stephen Westaby was born with the necessary coordination and manual dexterity, it was a head trauma sustained during university that gifted him the qualities of an exceptional heart surgeon: qualities that are frequently associated with psychopathy. His thirty-five-year career has been characterised by fearlessness and ruthless ambition; leaving empathy at the hospital door as thousands of patients put their lives in his hands. For heart surgeons, the inevitable cost of failure is death and in The Knife's Edge, Westaby reflects on the unique mindset of those who are drawn to this exhilarating and often tragic profession. We discover the pioneers who grasped opportunities and took chances to drive innovation and save lives. Often difficult, uninhibited and fearless, theirs is a field constantly threatened by the risk of public failure. Like those before him, Westaby refuses to draw the line in his search of a lifetime solution to problems of the heart. His determination is unerring - a steadfastness underpinned by his unusual mind. But as we glimpse into the future of cardiac surgery, for all its remarkable scientific advancement, one question remains: within the confines of socialised medical healthcare systems, how can heart surgeons - individuals often hardwired with avoidance of self-doubt, a penchant for glory and a flagrant disregard for authority - truly flourish?||1 online resource||617.412092|ebook - ebook|04/04/2019|2019-04-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008285807?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_nhNDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Nadia Murad was born and raised in Kocho, a small village of farmers and shepherds in northern Iraq. A member of the Yazidi community, she and her brothers and sisters lived a quiet life. Nadia had dreams of becoming a history teacher or opening her own beauty salon.    On August 15th, 2014, when Nadia was just twenty-one years old, this life ended. Islamic State militants massacred the people of her village, executing men who refused to convert to Islam and women too old to become sex slaves. Six of Nadia's brothers were killed, and her mother soon after, their bodies swept into mass graves. Nadia was taken to Mosul and forced, along with thousands of other Yazidi girls, into the ISIS slave trade.    Nadia would be held captive by several militants and repeatedly raped and beaten. Finally, she managed a narrow escape through the streets of Mosul, finding shelter in the home of a Sunni Muslim family whose eldest son risked his life to smuggle her to safety.   Today, Nadia's story-as a witness to the Islamic State's brutality, a survivor of rape, a refugee, a Yazidi-has forced the world to pay attention to the ongoing genocide in Iraq. It is a call to action, a testament to the human will to survive, and a love letter to a lost country, a fragile community, and a family torn apart by war., Text Difficulty 6 - Text Difficulty 8, 1020 Lexile.||1 online resource||956.7044311|ebook - ebook|11/07/2017|2017-11-07|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781524760458?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JxQcDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Kertzer|Pius XI, Pope, 1857-1939., Mussolini, Benito, 1883-1945., Fascism and the Catholic Church Italy.|Religion|Analyzes the relationship between Pius XI and the notorious Italian dictator, tracing how after coming into power in the same year they forged covert ties to one another to consolidate power and pursue political goals., The Pope and Mussolini tells the story of two men who came to power in 1922 and together changed the course of twentieth-century history. In most respects, they could not have been more different. One was scholarly and devout, the other thuggish and profane. Yet Pius XI and 'Il Duce' had many things in common. They shared a distrust of democracy and a visceral hatred of Communism. Both were prone to sudden fits of temper and were fiercely protective of the prerogatives of their office. ('We have many interests to protect,' the Pope declared, soon after Mussolini seized control of the government in 1922.) Each relied on the other to consolidate his power and achieve his political goals. In a challenge to the conventional history of this period, in which a heroic Church does battle with the Fascist regime, Kertzer shows how Pius XI played a crucial role in making Mussolini's dictatorship possible and keeping him in power. In exchange for Vatican support, Mussolini restored many of the privileges the Church had lost and gave in to the pope's demands that the police enforce Catholic morality. Yet in the last years of his life--as the Italian dictator grew ever closer to Hitler--the pontiff's faith in this treacherous bargain started to waver. With his health failing, he began to lash out at the Duce and threatened to denounce Mussolini's anti-Semitic racial laws before it was too late. Horrified by the threat to the Church-Fascist alliance, the Vatican's inner circle, including the future Pope Pius XII, struggled to restrain the headstrong pope from destroying a partnership that had served both the Church and the dictator for many years. The Pope and Mussolini brims with memorable portraits of the men who helped enable the reign of Fascism in Italy: Father Pietro Tacchi Venturi, Pius's personal emissary to the dictator, a wily anti-Semite known as Mussolini's Rasputin; Victor Emmanuel III, the king of Italy, an object of widespread derision who lacked the stature--literally and figuratively--to stand up to the domineering Duce; and Cardinal Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli, whose political skills and ambition made him Mussolini's most powerful ally inside the Vatican, and positioned him to succeed the pontiff as the controversial Pius XII, whose actions during World War II would be subject for debate for decades to come.--book jacket.||xxxiii, 549 pages : illustrations, maps ; 25 cm||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|01/28/2014|2014-01-28|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780679645535?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yYh3AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

You'll learn about a wide range of successful community models, including a tiny-home village for people who had been chronically houseless in Austin, Texas; a study circle to build connection between Native and non-Native people in a small town in South Dakota; a 500-member community choir in Columbus, Ohio; and a Buddhist center in Barre, Massachusetts committed to bringing greater diversity to the Dharma. Throughout the book, you'll reflect: How can we cultivate these traits of vibrant community in our own lives? What would it look like to prioritize caring and acceptance in our interactions with others? How can we create a climate of true inclusivity, one where our differences both challenge and strengthen us? How can we learn to feel more comfortable with tension and acquire the skills to move through conflict toward creative solutions? What would happen if we incorporated meaningful rituals into our communities and made a point of celebrating each other?  With intention and practice, we can transform our social relationships and build communities that appreciate difference, encourage authentic expression, and foster an environment of belonging and mutual care. This book will inspire you to make the transformative leap from me to we, creating communal, loving spaces in which to connect-and thrive-together.||1 online resource||302.545|ebook - ebook|04/04/2023|2023-04-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781623177645?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RhB5EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

An accessible, enjoyable, and detailed road map for addressing even the most delicate topics with confidence and compassion.-Lisa Damour, PhD, author of  Untangled ,  Under Pressure , and  The Emotional Lives of Teenagers   Almost everything about puberty has changed since today's adults went through it. It starts, on average, two years earlier and stretches through high school . . . and for some, beyond. Gens Z and Alpha are also contending with a whole host of thorny issues that parents didn't experience in their own youth but nonetheless need to understand: everything from social media and easy-access pornography to gender identities and new or newly-potent drugs. Talking about any of this is like puberty itself: Awkward! But it's also critical for the health, happiness, and safety of today's kids. Bewildered adults have begged for reliable and relatable information about the modern adolescent experience.  This Is So Awkward  answers their call. Written by a pediatrician and a puberty educator-together the hosts of a lively and popular podcast on puberty, and moms to six teens between them-this is the handbook everyone has been searching for, and includes: • Pointed advice about how to talk to kids about almost anything: acne, body odor, growth spurts, eating disorders, mood swings, sexuality, and more. • Science-based explanations for all of puberty's physical, emotional, and social changes, including the many ways hormones affect kids both above and below the neck. • What adults needs to know about today's teen culture: their mental health drivers, the un-gendering of body image issues, the ways they think about sexual orientation, and more.  • Invaluable commentary straight from young adults just out the other side of adolescence that highlights what they wish the adults in their lives had known or done differently. Eye-opening and reassuring,  This Is So Awkward  will help adults understand the turbulent pubescent decade and become confident guides for today's kids.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|10/10/2023|2023-10-10|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593580967?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bLimEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It takes a historical perspective on how the market emerged, developed, and became what it is today-the biggest commodity market in the world. It is mature and complex, but far from perfect.  Throughout most of its 150-year history, the oil market has been monopolised by companies and governments. For only a fraction of that, oil traded in a relatively free market. As a result, we had to live with 'big oil', economic shocks, high oil prices, instability and wars. Using a simple concept of market power, this book will explain the meaning of 'oil price' and how it is established while offering a valuable lesson for other commodities.  Market power is the key to understanding the 'price of oil'. This book uses a simple concept of price-makers and price-takers to examine the evolution of oil markets, their structure, and prices. The early decades of the oil industry were competitive with low barriers to entry. Barely 25 years later, the Standard Oil company created a refining monopoly, buying oil at its own 'posted' price. In the following century, the cartel of major oil companies, helped by their governments, did the same at the international level. OPEC helped producing governments regain control of their own resources, but the organisation was never able to retain a similar level of control. After 1986 price collapse, OPEC abdicated the price-making function in favour of the market. While it never gave up attempts to influence prices, OPEC had to link their official prices to one of the global oil benchmarks. Modern international oil markets function because of oil benchmarks such as Brent, WTI and Dubai.   This book showcases:    �How oil traders played a prominent role in development of the industry   �How policies of consuming nations helped oil cartels   �Why and how the US price of oil was negative   �How AI has changed the way markets operate and the way in which the markets are likely to change in future This book explores how oil markets grew, functioned, and have occasionally failed to do their job. The ecosystem of derivatives or 'paper barrels' trading in far greater volume than physical oil plays a very important role in mitigating risk. With this core tenant, setting the 'price of oil' is explained in detail.||1 online resource||338.27282|ebook - ebook|05/19/2021|2021-05-19|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9783030717186?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8W4vEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Referring to the defensive moves that white people make when challenged racially, white fragility is characterized by emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and by behaviors including argumentation and silence. These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium and prevent any meaningful cross-racial dialogue. In this in-depth exploration, DiAngelo examines how white fragility develops, how it protects racial inequality, and what we can do to engage more constructively.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|06/26/2018|2018-06-26|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780807047422?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZfQ3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

If you experienced physical or emotional abuse, neglect, or abandonment as a child, you may struggle with unhealthy relationships as an adult. Hurtful attachments with our caregivers in early childhood can lay the foundation for toxic relationships. Those experiences can even affect the way we handle conflict, our feelings toward sex, and our expectations of our partners. But this doesn't mean you can't change. This book will help you gain a greater awareness of the trauma bonds that prevent you from getting the love, safety, and security you desire.    In  Why Can't I Let You Go , relationship expert Michelle Skeen will help you identify your attachment style, core beliefs, and the harmful behavior patterns that are keeping you stuck in toxic relationships. You'll learn proven-effective skills to help you interrupt these unhelpful patterns and attachments in new and old relationships. You'll also discover what you really value in relationships and go on to develop healthy, secure, and lasting love.    Understanding yourself and your deeply held, and often unconscious, beliefs is the first step toward liberating yourself from trauma bonds. Change isn't easy, but in time you'll realize that it's easier and less painful than the heartache and self-doubt you've been enduring for years. With this compassionate guide, you'll find the support and guidance needed to create the loving relationships you truly want.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|01/02/2024||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781648481888?s=MD|

Barely educated and valued since childhood strictly for his labor, Ernaux's father had grown into a hard, practical man who showed his family little affection. Narrating his slow ascent towards material comfort, Ernaux's cold observation reveals the shame that haunted her father throughout his life. She scrutinizes the importance he attributed to manners and language that came so unnaturally to him as he struggled to provide for his family with a grocery store and cafe in rural France. Over the course of the book, Ernaux grows up to become the uncompromising observer now familiar to the world, while her father matures into old age with a staid appreciation for life as it is and for a daughter he cautiously, even reluctantly admires. A Man's Place is the companion book to her critically acclaimed memoir about her mother, A Woman's Story.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|01/04/2011|2012-05-29|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781609802554?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6HD8If3kJuYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

He constructed a fleet of customized unicycles and a flamethrowing trumpet, outfoxed Vegas casinos, and built juggling robots. He also wrote the seminal text of the digital revolution, which has been called the Magna Carta of the Information Age. His discoveries would lead contemporaries to compare him to Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton. His work anticipated by decades the world we'd be living in today-and gave mathematicians and engineers the tools to bring that world to pass. In this elegantly written, exhaustively researched biography, Jimmy Soni and Rob Goodman reveal Claude Shannon's full story for the first time. It's the story of a small-town Michigan boy whose career stretched from the era of room-sized computers powered by gears and string to the age of Apple. It's the story of the origins of our digital world in the tunnels of MIT and the idea factory of Bell Labs, in the scientists' war with Nazi Germany, and in the work of Shannon's collaborators and rivals, thinkers like Alan Turing, John von Neumann, Vannevar Bush, and Norbert Wiener. And it's the story of Shannon's life as an often reclusive, always playful genius. With access to Shannon's family and friends, A Mind at Play brings this singular innovator and creative genius to life.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|07/18/2017|2017-07-18|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781476766706?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ABlpDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

As any reader of murder mysteries can tell you, poison is one of the most enduring—and popular—weapons of choice for a scheming murderer. It can be slipped into a drink, smeared onto the tip of an arrow or the handle of a door, even filtered through the air we breathe. But how exactly do these poisons work to break our bodies down, and what can we learn from the damage they inflict?  In a fascinating blend of popular science, medical history, and true crime, Dr. Neil Bradbury explores this most morbidly captivating method of murder from a cellular level. Alongside real-life accounts of murderers and their crimes—some notorious, some forgotten, some still unsolved—are the equally compelling stories of the poisons involved: eleven molecules of death that work their way through the human body and, paradoxically, illuminate the way in which our bodies function.  Drawn from historical records and current news headlines,  A Taste for Poison  weaves together the tales of spurned lovers, shady scientists, medical professionals and political assassins to show how the precise systems of the body can be impaired to lethal effect through the use of poison. From the deadly origins of the gin & tonic cocktail to the arsenic-laced wallpaper in Napoleon's bedroom,  A Taste for Poison  leads readers on a riveting tour of the intricate, complex systems that keep us alive—or don't.||1 online resource||615.900|ebook - ebook|02/01/2022|2022-02-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781250270764?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dB4QEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In this last of three volumes on emptiness, the Dalai Lama takes us through the Sautrantika, Yogacara, and Svatantrika views on the ultimate nature of reality and the Prasangikas' thorough responses to these, so that we gain the correct view of emptiness—the selflessness of both persons and phenomena. This view entails negating inherent existence while also being able to establish conventional existence: emptiness does not mean nothingness. We then learn how to meditate on the correct view by cultivating pristine wisdom that is the union of serenity and insight as taught in the Pali, Chinese, and Tibetan traditions. Such meditation, when combined with the altruistic intention of bodhicitta, leads to the complete eradication of all defilements that obscure our minds. This volume also introduces us to the tathagatagarbha—the buddha essence—and how it is understood in both Tibet and China. Is it permanent? Does everyone have it? In addition, the discussion of sudden and gradual awakening in Zen (Chan) Buddhism and in Tibetan Buddhism is fascinating.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|08/29/2023|2023-08-29|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781614299004?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EOqsEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Much of our behavior is influenced by factors that lie outside our conscious awareness; our decisions are often made not after careful deliberation (as is commonly assumed) but driven by cues in our environment. The behavioral systems approach applies evidence about actual human behavior-rather than assumptions about it-to practical problems. It is increasingly used by governments and businesses, which have discovered that a subtle nudge sometimes works better than an explicit rule. This volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series offers an accessible introduction to behavioral insights, describing core features, origins, and practical examples.||1 online resource||361.1|ebook - ebook|09/01/2020|2020-09-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780262360142?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AM_tDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Undefeated from the late 1970s through his final fight in the Tokyo Dome in 2000, Rickson Gracie amassed hundreds of victories in the street, on the mat, at the beach, and in the ring. He has joined the pantheon that includes Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris, and Jackie Chan as one of the most famous martial artists of the twentieth century. Jiu-Jitsu, the fighting style developed and pioneered by his family, has become one of the world's most prominent martial arts, and Vale Tudo, the anything goes style of Brazilian street fighting over which the Gracies had a monopoly, was an early precursor to the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Simply put, without the Gracie family, there would be no sport of MMA, no 4-billion-dollar UFC empire, and no Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu at strip malls all across America.  In Breathe, for the first time, Rickson reveals the full story of how his father and uncles came to develop Jiu-Jitsu, what it was like to grow up among several generations of world-renowned fighters from the Gracie clan, and the principles and skills that guided him to his undefeated record. From learning to assert himself on the streets of Rio to gaining fame and honor in Japan and emerging through heartbreaking tragedy, the martial arts master shares tales of overcoming challenges, extolling universal virtues and showing readers how pride and ego are the enemies of success.   With never-before-seen photos and profound insights into the sport and way of life that only a studied legend can provide, Breathe is an entertaining and magnified view of an enduring legacy as well as an inspiring tale of weathering life's complexities and overcoming them with style and grace.||1 online resource||796.8092|ebook - ebook|08/10/2021|2021-08-10|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780063018976?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sOkHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

But when painful trials, unmet needs, or lost dreams assail, do you wonder if God can still be trusted?    What do you do when facing a challenge that seems insurmountable? Do you believe God can be trusted? In Can You Still Trust God?, Charles Stanley reveals three essential beliefs for trusting God:   God is perfect in His love  God is infinite in wisdom, and  God is absolutely sovereign  Even when you cannot understand why God would allow certain situations to occur, these core beliefs form the basis for trusting Him. Your ability to receive the blessings God has for you is determined by the degree to which these wise truths are embedded in your soul.  Stanley then presents five blessings that can be yours when you choose to believe God can be trusted, even when you do not know what the next day will bring. You can face any circumstance with confidence and hope because it is not your strength, wisdom, energy, or power that is the ultimate source of victory. It is God's ability. When you trust Him, you tap into an eternal force that cannot be harnessed by any human constraints.  Can You Still Trust God? is a message of hope for Christians struggling to reconcile the suffering and turmoil in the world with a loving God. Pastors, ministers, and Bible study leaders will find a resource for teaching their communities about God's promises and how to deepen their trust in Him.||1 online resource||231.042|ebook - ebook|03/16/2021|2021-03-16|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780785247579?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rgr-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Sakyong Mipham.|Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism|Mipham, Sakyong|Mipham, Sakyong.|Chögyam Trungpa|Spiritual life Buddhism, Buddhist philosophy, Electronic books., Nonfiction., Philosophy.|Religion|In this modern spiritual classic, the Tibetan meditation master Chögyam Trungpa highlights the commonest pitfall to which every aspirant on the spiritual path falls prey: what he calls spiritual materialism.  The universal tendency, he shows, is to see spirituality as a process of self-improvement-the impulse to develop and refine the ego when the ego is, by nature, essentially empty. The problem is that ego can convert anything to its own use, he said, even spirituality. His incisive, compassionate teachings serve to wake us up from this trick we all play on ourselves, and to offer us a far brighter reality: the true and joyous liberation that inevitably involves letting go of the self rather than working to improve it. It is a message that has resonated with students for nearly thirty years, and remains fresh as ever today. This new edition includes a foreword by Chögyam Trungpa's son and lineage holder, Sakyong Mipham.||||294.3444|ebook - ebook|11/15/2010|2010-09-28|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780834821224?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1XuwqkOeAE8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Dare to Lead Like a Girl is a holistic look at how to achieve purpose and joy at work. It is about turning the world of work into a place where empathy, intuition, passion, and resilience take their rightful place, where women can lead like women and men can tap into their more feminine leadership traits and dare to lead (more) like a girl!  Dalia Feldheim was one of the marketing directors behind the 2014 global Always ad campaign #LikeAGirl. This message touched a nerve for women and men alike becoming much more than a commercial - as it became an icon for women's empowerment. The ad was selected by Forbes as one of the 10 most influential campaigns of the decade.   In the commercial, while a young girl understand the phrase 'run like a girl' to mean, run as fast as you can, somewhere along the way, doing things like a girl becomes an insult. The goal of the commercial was to change the meaning of words and reclaim the phrase to simply mean be proud of who you are.  With Dalia's new book it is time to reclaim that phrase once again and this time in the world of leadership.   It's time to stop asking our women leaders to lead like men and instead start learning from what is working for our women leaders-and share that wisdom with everyone, men and women alike. Dare toLead Like a Girl is a provocative call to action to all leaders to stop wearing an emotional mask at work and connect to their more feminine leadership traits - owning their passion, perseverance, people skills, and positivity.  With her flare for relatable storytelling, Dalia shares her executive leadership journey of over two decades backed by theoretical underpinning from the world of psychology, business, and mindfulness to encourage leaders to connect to their more feminine super powers: be courageous, lead from their heart, and Dare to Lead (more) Like a Girl.||1 online resource||303.34082|ebook - ebook|06/24/2022||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781538163535?s=MD|

Lasse Heje Pedersen.|Efficiently Inefficient|Pedersen, Lasse Heje|Pedersen, Lasse Heje.|Lasse Heje Pedersen|Nonfiction., Investment analysis., Investments., Portfolio management., Capital market., Securities Prices., Liquidity (Economics), Business., Finance., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|Efficiently Inefficient describes the key trading strategies used by hedge funds and demystifies the secret world of active investing. Leading financial economist Lasse Heje Pedersen combines the latest research with real-world examples and interviews with top hedge fund managers to show how certain trading strategies make money-and why they sometimes don't. Pedersen views markets as neither perfectly efficient nor completely inefficient. Rather, they are inefficient enough that money managers can be compensated for their costs through the profits of their trading strategies and efficient enough that the profits after costs do not encourage additional active investing. Understanding how to trade in this efficiently inefficient market provides a new, engaging way to learn finance. Pedersen analyzes how the market price of stocks and bonds can differ from the model price, leading to new perspectives on the relationship between trading results and finance theory. He explores several different areas in depth-fundamental tools for investment management, equity strategies, macro strategies, and arbitrage strategies-and he looks at such diverse topics as portfolio choice, risk management, equity valuation, and yield curve logic. The book's strategies are illuminated further by interviews with leading hedge fund managers: Lee Ainslie, Cliff Asness, Jim Chanos, Ken Griffin, David Harding, John Paulson, Myron Scholes, and George Soros. Efficiently Inefficient effectively demonstrates how financial markets really work.Free problem sets are available online at http://www.lhpedersen.com||1 online resource||332.6|ebook - ebook|04/13/2015|2015-04-13|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781400865734?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=e0y3BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

His life? Magnificent! And his ministry? Impressive. While assigned sainthood by some today, by his own description he was the chief of all sinners. No other person in the Bible, aside from Christ Himself, had a more profound influence on his world and ours than Paul. He was a man of real grit, with a firmness of mind and spirit and unyielding courage in the face of personal hardship and danger. Tough, tenacious, and fiercely relentless, Paul pursued his divine mission with unflinching resolve. And God used him mightily to turn the world upside down for Christ in his generation.  But Paul's message and his style were also marked by gentle grace. This man, who tormented and killed the saints of God, understood and explained grace better than any of his contemporaries. Why? Because he never got over his own gratitude as a recipient of it. God's super-abounding grace transformed this once-violent aggressor into a humble-but-powerful spokesman for Christ. A man with that much grit desperately needed that much grace. Perhaps that's why Paul's life is such a source of hope for us. If the chief of sinners can be forgiven and become God's chosen vessel, can He not forgive and use us as well? He can, if we too become people of both grace and grit. Paul is the sixth of a multi-volume series exploring Great Lives from God's Word and searching them to find the qualities that made them great. Join us for an exciting, in-depth look at this amazing life, as only Chuck Swindoll can describe it: Paul: A Man of Grace and Grit.||1 online resource||225.92|ebook - ebook|12/28/2009|2009-12-28|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781418515508?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HivGLGNYtuIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Yet it was only in the 1960s that the first road linking the Kingdom of the Thunder Dragon with India was opened, and since 1974 only a strictly limited number of tourists have been allowed to visit each year. Martin Uitz, a renowned expert on Bhutan, describes how the Bhutanese, in pursuit of the principle of Gross National Happiness, are carefully moving towards a more modern future, including a constitution and democracy, whilst preserving their traditional society and attempting to conserve the environment. Uitz made many fascinating discoveries in this enigmatic Kingdom. He was able to explain why the only traffic light was taken out of service, why six men are not allowed to go on a journey together, and what the subtle eroticism of a traditional hot-stone bath is all about. Along the way he also discovered that the Bhutanese hills are more alive with Edelweiss than the hills around his native Salzburg.||1 online resource||915.498|ebook - ebook|02/13/2017||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781907973321?s=MD|

Peter Enns.|How the Bible Actually Works|Enns, Peter|Enns, Peter.|Peter Enns|Bible Criticism, interpretation, etc., Bible., Nonfiction., Wisdom Biblical teaching., Wisdom Biblical teaching., Christian Nonfiction., Religion & Spirituality., Electronic books., Criticism, interpretation, etc.|Religion|Controversial evangelical Bible scholar, popular blogger and podcast host of The Bible for Normal People, and author of The Bible Tells Me So and The Sin of Certainty explains that the Bible is not an instruction manual or rule book but a powerful learning tool that nurtures our spiritual growth by refusing to provide us with easy answers but instead forces us to acquire wisdom. For many Christians, the Bible is a how-to manual filled with literal truths about belief about God that must be strictly followed. But the Bible is not static, Peter Enns argues. It does not hold easy answers to the perplexing questions and issues that confront us in our daily lives. Rather, the Bible is a dynamic instrument for study that not only offers an abundance of insights but provokes us to find our own answers to spiritual questions, cultivating God's wisdom within us. The Bible becomes a confusing mess when we expect it to function as a rulebook for faith. But when we allow the Bible to determine our expectations, we see that Wisdom, not answers, is the Bible's true subject matter, writes Enns. This distinction, he points out, is important because when we come to the Bible expecting it to be a textbook intended by God to give us unwavering certainty about our faith, we are actually creating problems for ourselves. The Bible, in other words, really isn't the problem; having the wrong expectation is what interferes with our reading.Rather than considering the Bible as an ancient book weighed down with problems, flaws, and contradictions that must be defended by modern readers, Enns offers a vision of the holy scriptures as an inspired and empowering resource to help us better understand how to live as a person of faith today. How the Bible Actually Works makes clear that there is no one right way to read the Bible. Moving us beyond the damaging idea that being right is the most important measure of faith, Enns's freeing approach to Bible study helps us to instead focus on pursuing enlightenment and building our relationship with God-which is exactly what the Bible was designed to do.||1 online resource||220.1|ebook - ebook|02/19/2019|2019-02-19|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062686770?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n3pbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In 2010, award-winning journalist John Bowe learned that his cousin Bill, a longtime extreme recluse living in his parents' basement, had, at the age of fifty-nine, overcome a lifetime of shyness and isolation-and gotten happily married. Bill credited his turnaround to Toastmasters, the world's largest organization devoted to teaching the art of public speaking. Fascinated by the possibility that speech training could foster the kind of psychological well-being more commonly sought through psychiatric treatment, and intrigued by the notion that words can serve as medicine, Bowe set out to discover the origins of speech training-and to learn for himself how to speak better in public. From the birth of democracy in Ancient Greece until two centuries ago, education meant, in addition to reading and writing, years of learning specific, easily taught language techniques for interacting with others. Nowadays, absent such education, the average American speaks 16,000 to 20,000 words every day, but 74 percent of us suffer from speech anxiety. As he joins Toastmasters and learns, step-by-step, to successfully overcome his own speech anxiety, Bowe muses upon our record levels of loneliness, social isolation, and political divisiveness. What would it mean for Americans to learn once again the simple art of talking to one another? Bowe shows that learning to speak in public means more than giving a decent speech without nervousness (or a total meltdown). Learning to connect with others bestows upon us an enhanced sense of freedom, power, and belonging.||1 online resource||808.51|ebook - ebook|08/11/2020|2020-08-11|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593133163?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hK2-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Through a multi-disciplinary consideration of fauna, Timothy P. Barnard weaves together a series of tales to document how animals were cherished, slaughtered, monitored and employed to provide insight into how imperial rule was imposed on an island in Southeast Asia. Fauna and their histories of interacting with humans, thus, become useful tools for understanding our past, revealing the effects of establishing a colony on the biodiversity of a region, and the institutions that quickly transformed it. All animals, including humans, have been creatures of imperialism in Singapore. Their stories teach us lessons about the structures that upheld such a society and how it developed over time.||1 online resource||304.2095957|ebook - ebook|01/07/2021||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9789813251465?s=MD|

But even for some of the most common mental health problems, specialists argue over whether the answers lie in the person's biology, their psychology or their circumstances.   As a cognitive neuropsychiatrist, Anthony David brings together many fields of enquiry, from social and cognitive psychology to neurology. The key for each patient might be anything from a traumatic memory to a chemical imbalance, an unhealthy way of thinking or a hidden tumour.   Patrick believes he is dead. Jennifer's schizophrenia medication helped with her voices but did it cause Parkinson's? Emma is in a coma - or is she just refusing to respond?    Drawing from Professor David's career as a clinician and academic, these fascinating case studies reveal the unique complexity of the human mind, stretching the limits of our understanding.||1 online resource||616.89|ebook - ebook|02/06/2020|2020-02-06|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781786077066?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ht-vDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Ralph Waldo Emerson was a spiritual revolutionary whose profound vision of human potential came to define the American character. Known as America's original Stoic, he offered a radical message of optimism, authenticity, and self-realization that is more necessary today than ever.  In this timely, remarkable book, noted memoirist and teacher Mark Matousek reveals the depths of Emerson's extraordinary wisdom, demonstrating how his timeless philosophy can help us navigate the challenges of contemporary life. Using personal stories, psychological research, and life lessons from Emerson and his contemporaries-including Thoreau and Whitman- he offers practical lessons in the art of living. In the following pages, you will discover:  Why Emerson should be considered America's original stoic  How to dispel the illusion of our own powerlessness and turn toward boundless human potential  Practical tools for cultivating happiness in a fragile, unpredictable, dangerous world  The gifts of self-reliance and spiritual renewal necessary for thriving  A roadmap to discovering essential wisdom on living an authentic and meaningful life  Emerson's far-reaching vision of excellence and spiritual flourishing is the medicine we need to heal ourselves. Trust yourself, he teaches. Once you make a decision, the universe conspires to make it happen. This philosophy of hope, known as transcendentalism, is the vein of gold in the American psyche.  Lessons from an American Stoic  helps us to reclaim our national treasure.||1 online resource||158.1|ebook - ebook|06/13/2023|2023-06-13|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780063059719?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xv18EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Brief an den Vater. English.|Literary Collections|Franz Kafka wrote this letter to Hermann Kafka in November 1919; he was then thirty-six years old. Max Brod relates that Kafka actually gave it to his mother to hand to his father, hoping that it might renew a relationship that had disintegrated into tension and frustration on both sides. Kafka's probing of the abyss between them spared neither his father nor himself, and his cry for acceptance has an undertone of despair. He could not help seeing the lack of understanding between father and son as another moment in the universal predicament depicited in so much of his work. Probably realizing the futility of her son's gesture, his mother did not deliver the letter, but returned it to Kafka instead. Kafka died five years later, in 1924, of tuberculosis.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|06/26/2013|2013-06-26|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780804150750?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Gq7DnRrYf2kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Mariana Mazzucato.|Mission Economy|Mazzucato, Mariana|Mazzucato, Mariana.|Mariana Mazzucato|Nonfiction., Business., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|She offers something both broad and scarce: a compelling new story about how to create a desirable future.-New York Times     An award-winning author and leading international economist delivers a hard-hitting and much needed critique of modern capitalism in which she argues that, to solve the massive crises facing us, we must be innovative-we must use collaborative, mission-oriented thinking while also bringing a stakeholder view of public private partnerships which means not only taking risks together but also sharing the rewards.    Capitalism is in crisis. The rich have gotten richer-the 1 percent, those with more than $1 million, own 44 percent of the world's wealth-while climate change is transforming-and in some cases wiping out-life on the planet. We are plagued by crises threatening our lives, and this situation is unsustainable. But how do we fix these problems decades in the making?   Mission Economics looks at the grand challenges facing us in a radically new way. Global warming, pollution, dementia, obesity, gun violence, mobility-these environmental, health, and social dilemmas are huge, complex, and have no simple solutions. Mariana Mazzucato argues we need to think bigger and mobilize our resources in a way that is as bold as inspirational as the moon landing-this time to the most 'wicked' social problems of our time.. We can only begin to find answers if we fundamentally restructure capitalism to make it inclusive, sustainable, and driven by innovation that tackles concrete problems from the digital divide, to health pandemics, to our polluted cities. That means changing government tools and culture, creating new markers of corporate governance, and ensuring that corporations, society, and the government coalesce to share a common goal.  We did it to go to the moon. We can do it again to fix our problems and improve the lives of every one of us. We simply can no longer afford not to.||1 online resource||330.122|ebook - ebook|03/23/2021|2021-03-23|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780063046269?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qszpDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

During the American book tour for his memoir,  Hitch-22 , Christopher Hitchens collapsed in his hotel room with excruciating pain in his chest. As he would later write in the first of a series of deeply moving  Vanity Fair  pieces, he was being deported 'from the country of the well across the stark frontier that marks off the land of malady.'

It was the Big Five who played a preponderant role not only in transforming Penang into a regional entrepot and a business and financial base, but also in reconfiguring maritime trading patterns and the business orientation of the region in the nineteenth century. Departing from the colonial vantage point, this book examines a web of transnational, hybrid and fluid networks of the Big Five comprising of family relationship, sworn brotherhood, political alliance and business partnerships, which linked Penang and its surrounding states (western Malay states, southwestern Siam, southern Burma, and the north and eastern coasts of Sumatra) together to form one economically unified geographical region, having inextricable links to China and India. With these intertwining networks, the Big Five succeeded in establishing their dominance in all the major enterprises (trade, shipping, cash crop planting, tin mining, opium revenue farms), which constituted the linchpin of Penang's and its region's economy. By disentangling and dissecting this intricate web of networks, this book reveals the rise and decline of the Hokkien mercantile families' nearly century-long economic ascendancy in Penang and its region.Wong Yee Tuan's study of the five clans of Penang represents a major breakthrough in the study of the Malayan Chinese. He documents an extremely important aspect of the nineteenth-century Asian diaspora, exposing the intricate links between families, businesses, secret societies, revenue farms and public life of some of the key groups of Chinese in Penang and northern Malaya. The book weaves together the various strands of overseas Chinese life not only in Malaya, but also in the Netherlands Indies, Siam and China. Most importantly, it shows the process by which the Chinese leaders gained political, economic and social power as well as the way by which these powers were lost. - Carl A. Trocki, Emeritus Professor, Asian Studies, Queensland University of Technology, AustraliaThis volume can be situated within a growing historiographical current whereby regional studies of connections, networks and interactions are gradually transcending national histories. Incorporating commercial, ethnic and social elements, the history presented can be concurrently seen as a business case study, a sociological exploration, a political economy treatise and an inquiry into Hokkien networking. Wong Yee Tuan is to be congratulated on this signal study in how local, national and broader regional histories can be integrated. - Geoffrey Wade, ANU College of Asia and the Pacific, Australian National UniversityBy aligning family, socio-political and business interests, the leading Penang Hokkien clans centralized their 'home port' as a hub of regional commercial networks, thus successfully extending the trading colonies of Chinese diaspora westward to the edge of the Indian Ocean. Wong has fastidiously researched and compellingly proven this, with a clear eye for relevant cross-cultural collaborations with indigenous and international actors. The important legacy of the 'Big Five' clanhouses is now firmly embedded in the George Town World Heritage Site, inciting further inquiry into the cultural formation of collective entrepreneurship in Southeast Asia. - Khoo Salma Nasution, Heritage Advocate and Local Historian, Penang|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|01/17/2019|2016-04-29|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9789814695503?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IB1qDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Almost 30 years later, at the pinnacle of his success as founder and leader of Dell Technologies, he found himself embroiled in a battle for his company's survival. What he'd do next could ensure its legacy-or destroy it completely.    Play Nice But Win  is a riveting account of the three battles waged for Dell Technologies: one to launch it, one to keep it, and one to transform it. For the first time, Dell reveals the highs and lows of the company's evolution amidst a rapidly changing industry-and his own, as he matured into the CEO it needed. With humor and humility, he recalls the mentors who showed him how to turn his passion into a business; the competitors who became friends, foes, or both; and the sharks that circled, looking for weakness. What emerges is the long-term vision underpinning his success: that technology is ultimately about people and their potential.   More than an honest portrait of a leader at a crossroads,  Play Nice But Win  is a survival story proving that while anyone with technological insight and entrepreneurial zeal might build something great-it takes a leader to build something that lasts.||1 online resource||658.4092|ebook - ebook|10/05/2021|2021-10-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593087756?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZngZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It's painful for any organization or manager when people on their team aren't given the tools to succeed; and more painful still when the team member doesn't yet realize it. But by coaching through leadership, any manager of any organization can create a supportive structure that helps assign the right roles, resources, tools, and career opportunities that will best leverage their strengths.  Determines coachability and readiness for employee change and improvement  Builds awareness to deal with the right issues, challenges, and opportunities  Offers leaders/managers the tools to help a performer leverage their greatest gifts, talents, and strengths  Allows for dialogue and tactics to close gaps in experience, communication styles, and personality  Guides managers in how to have dialogue around difficult and important issues with their employees  Includes coaching principles, practices, and tools with practical, real-world examples  Offers strategies and tools to help employees become more motivated for effective change, action, and accountability  Each chapter includes a series of powerful and provocative coaching questions for any leader or manager to use immediately in the workplace.||1 online resource||658.407|ebook - ebook|12/17/2019|2019-12-17|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781119529033?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eJXFDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Even before 2020, chronic loneliness was a private experience of profound anguish that had become a public health crisis. Since then it has reached new heights. Loneliness assumes many forms, from enduring physical isolation to feeling rejected because of difference, and it can have devastating consequences for our physical and mental health. As the founder of Project UnLonely, Jeremy Nobel unpacks our personal and national experiences of loneliness to discover its roots and to show how we can take steps to find comfort and connection.      Dr. Nobel brings together many voices, from pioneering researchers, to leaders in business, education, the arts, and healthcare, to lonely people of every age, background, and circumstance. He discovers that the pandemic isolated us in ways that were not only physical, and that, at its core, a true sense of loneliness results from a disconnection to the self. He clarifies how meaningful reconnection can be nourished and sustained. And he reveals that an important component of the healing process is engaging in creativity, a powerful opportunity he shows us can be accessed by all.    Supportive and clear-eyed, this is the book we will take into our new normal and rely on for years to come.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|10/03/2023||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593191958?s=MD|

Miller|Nonfiction., Business., Self Help., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|No one can successfully achieve goals and new objectives, provide outstanding service, engage in exceptional teamwork, make change in their community or lead other people without personal accountability. After decades of working with organisations and individuals, John G. Miller knows that the troubles that plague them cannot be solved by pointing fingers and blaming others. Rather, the real solutions are found when each of us recognizes the value of our own accountability. In this book, Miller explains how negative, ill-focused questions like Who dropped the ball? harm rather than help. Conversely, when we begin to ask better questions - QBQs, questions behind the questions - and to see power in ourselves, then our lives and organisations are transformed. Succinct, insightful and practical, this book provides the tools for putting personal accountability into daily action, with astonishing results.||1 online resource||153.83|ebook - ebook|09/02/2021|2021-09-02|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781782838968?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IpkTEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Philip Yancey believes we are missing the supernatural hidden in everyday life.  In Rumors of Another World, Yancey investigates the natural world and discovers the supernatural hiding in plain view. He grapples with why God made the world and what our role truly is, and seeks to answer the question, 'How do I live in the natural world while expressing the values of the supernatural?'  Philip writes, 'I have come to understand faith as the highest form of integrated encounter. Faith puts together, assembles, re-orders, accepting the entire world as God's handiwork. We live among clues, like rescuers sifting through pieces of stained glass shattered by a bomb, and only with a blueprint or some memory of original design can we begin to connect the shards, to assemble them into a pattern that makes sense of our world.  'Nature and supernature are not two separate worlds, but different expressions of the same reality. To encounter the world as a whole, we need a more supernatural awareness of the natural world.'  Yancey invites readers to join him on a journey of discovery. He challenges us to tune into 'rumors of another world,' and connect the seen with the unseen. He promises that the grace-filled result will be a life of beauty, purpose, freedom, and faith.||1 online resource||248.4|ebook - ebook|05/18/2009|2009-05-18|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780310565963?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bD2L03AA4yMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

His name was Siddhartha Gautama, and he was discovering the astonishing capabilities of the human brain and the secrets of mental wellness and spiritual enlightenment, the foundation of Buddhism.Framed by the historical journey and teachings of the Buddha, Siddhartha's Brain shows how meditative and Buddhist practice anticipated the findings of modern neuroscience. Moving from the evolutionary history of the brain to the disorders and neuroses associated with our technology-driven world, James Kingsland explains why the ancient practice of mindfulness has been so beneficial and so important for human beings across time. Far from a New Age fad, the principles of meditation have deep scientific support and have been proven to be effective in combating many contemporary psychiatric disorders. Siddhartha posited that Our life is shaped by our mind; we become what we think. As we are increasingly driven to distraction by competing demands, our ability to focus and control our thoughts has never been more challenged-or more vital.Siddhartha's Brain offers a cutting-edge, big-picture assessment of meditation and mindfulness: how it works, what it does to our brains, and why meditative practice has never been more important.||1 online resource||294.34435|ebook - ebook|11/21/2023|2016-04-26|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062403865?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zwrVCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

[and others] ; foreword by Richard Budgett.||Lanham-New, Susan A.|Lanham-New, Susan A.||Nonfiction., Nutrition., Sports Physiological aspects., Exercise Physiological aspects., Medical., Electronic books., Budgett, Richard.||Please note that digital editions do not include all the illustrations found in the printed book.Now widely adopted on courses throughout the world, the prestigious Nutrition Society Textbook series provides students with the scientific basics in nutrition in the context of a systems and disease approach rather than on a nutrient by nutrient basis. In addition books provide a means to enable teachers and students to explore the core principles of nutrition and to apply these throughout their training to foster critical thinking at all times.This NS Textbook on Sport and Exercise Nutrition has been written to cover the latest information on the science and practice of sport and exercise nutrition. A key concept behind this textbook is that it aims to combine the viewpoints of world leading nutrition experts from both academia/research and a practical stand point. Plus where necessary there are additional practitioner based authors to ensure theory is translated into practice for each chapter in the form of either 'practice tips' or 'information sheets' at the end of relevant chapters.The textbook in essence can be divided into three distinct but integrated parts:Part 1: covers the key components of the science that supports the practice of sport and exercise nutrition including comprehensive reviews on: nutrients both in general and as exercise fuels; exercise physiology; hydration, micronutrients; and supplements.Part 2: moves into focusing on specific nutrition strategies to support different types of training including: resistance; power/sprint; middle distance/speed endurance; endurance; technical/skill, team; and specific competition nutrition needs.The unique format of this textbook is that it breaks down nutrition support into training specific as opposed to the traditional sport specific support. This reflects the majority of current sport and exercise requirements of the need to undertake concurrent training and therefore facilitating targeted nutrition support to the different training components through the various macro and micro training cycles.Part 3: explores some of the practical issues encountered in working in the sport and exercise nutrition field and includes key sport related topics such as: disability sport; weight management; eating disorders; bone and gut health; immunity; injury; travel; and special populations and situations.READERSHIP: Students of nutrition and dietetics at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. All those working in the field of nutrition and related health sciences.||1 online resource||613.71|ebook - ebook|08/08/2011||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781444344875?s=MD|

Sean D Young.|Stick with It|Young, Sean D.|Young, Sean D.|Sean D. Young|Nonfiction., Business., Psychology., Self-Improvement., Electronic books., Electronic book|Business & Economics|An award-winning psychologist and director of the UCLA Center for Digital Behavior shows everyone how to make real, lasting change in their lives in this exciting work of popular psychology that goes beyond The Power of Habit with science and practical strategies that can alter their problem behaviors&#8212;forever.Whether it's absent-minded mistakes at work, a weakness for junk food, a smart phone addiction, or a lack of exercise, everyone has some bad habit or behavior that they'd like to change. But wanting to change and actually doing it&#8212;and sticking with it&#8212;are two very different things.Dr. Sean Young, an authoritative new voice in the field of behavioral science, knows a great deal about our habits&#8212;how we make them and how we can break them. Stick with It is his fascinating look at the science of behavior, filled with crucial knowledge and practical advice to help everyone successfully alter their actions and improve their lives.As Dr. Young explains, you don't change behavior by changing the person, you do it by changing the process. Drawing on his own scientific research and that of other leading experts in the field, he explains why change can be difficult and identifies the crucial forces that combine to make transformation permanent, from the right way to create new habits to how to harness emotional meaning to motivate change. He also helps us understand how the mind often interferes with creating lasting change and how we can outsmart it, including using neurohacks to shortcut the brain's counterproductive instincts. In addition he provides a powerful corrective to the decades old science of habits, offering a next generation discussion of how habits can change behavior with the right approach.Packed with pragmatic exercises and stories of real people who have used them successfully, Stick with It shows that it is possible to control spending, stick to a diet, become more social, exercise regularly, stop compulsively checking e-mail, and overcome problem behaviors&#8212;forever.|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||158.1|ebook - ebook|02/27/2024|2017-06-20|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062692894?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R7TnDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now, Lanier, who participates in no social media, offers powerful and personal reasons for all of us to leave these dangerous online platforms.Lanier's reasons for freeing ourselves from social media's poisonous grip include its tendency to bring out the worst in us, to make politics terrifying, to trick us with illusions of popularity and success, to twist our relationship with the truth, to disconnect us from other people even as we are more connected than ever, to rob us of our free will with relentless targeted ads. How can we remain autonomous in a world where we are under continual surveillance and are constantly being prodded by algorithms run by some of the richest corporations in history that have no way of making money other than being paid to manipulate our behavior? How could the benefits of social media possibly outweigh the catastrophic losses to our personal dignity, happiness, and freedom? Lanier remains a tech optimist, so while demonstrating the evil that rules social media business models today, he also envisions a humanistic setting for social networking that can direct us toward a richer and fuller way of living and connecting with our world.||1 online resource||302.231|ebook - ebook|05/29/2018|2018-05-29|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781250196699?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NZVJDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Packed with extraordinarily helpful insights and inspiring true stories, award-winning journalist and prominent end-of-life expert Katy Butler shows how to thrive in later life (even when coping with a chronic medical condition), how to get the best from our health system, and how to make your own good death more likely. This handbook of step by step preparations-practical, communal, physical, and sometimes spiritual-will help you make the most of your remaining time, be it decades, years, or months. Butler explains how to successfully age in place and delay decline, why to pick a younger doctor and how to have an honest conversation with her, when not to call 911, and how to make your death a sacred rite of passage rather than a medical event. This down-to-earth manual for living, aging and dying with meaning and even joy is based on Butler's own experience caring for aging parents, as well as hundreds of interviews with people who have successfully navigated a fragmented health system and helped their loved ones have good deaths. It also draws on advice from nationally recognized experts in family medicine, palliative care, geriatrics, oncology, hospice, and other medical specialties. Inspired by the medieval death manual Ars Moriendi, or the Art of Dying, The Art of Dying Well is the definitive update for our modern age, and illuminates the path to a better end of life.||1 online resource||616.029|ebook - ebook|02/19/2019|2019-02-19|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781501135323?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VjxqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

If we who had experienced it, I reasoned, did not reveal the bitter truth, people simply would not believe the extent of the Nazis' evil. I wanted to share our life, the events and our struggle to survive.' Thomas Geve was just 15 years old when he was liberated from Buchenwald concentration camp on 11 April 1945. It was the third concentration camp he had survived. Upon arrival at Auschwitz- Birkenau, Thomas was separated from his mother and left to fend for himself in the men's camp of Auschwitz I, at the age of 13. During the 22 months he was imprisoned, he was subjected to, and forced to observe first-hand, the inhumane world of Nazi concentration camps. On his eventual release Thomas felt compelled to capture daily life in the death camps in more than eighty profoundly moving drawings. Infamous scenarios synonymous with this dark period of history were portrayed in poignant but simplistic detail with extraordinary accuracy. Despite the unspeakable events he experienced, Thomas decided to become an active witness and tell the truth about life in the camps. He has spoken to audiences from around the world and continues to raise awareness about the Holocaust. The Boy Who Drew Auschwitz presents a rare living testimony through the eyes of a child who had the unique ability to observe and remember every detail around him and chose to document it all.||1 online resource||940.5318092|ebook - ebook|01/21/2021|2021-01-21|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008406400?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=du3yDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In  The Genetic Lottery , Harden introduces readers to the latest genetic science, dismantling dangerous ideas about racial superiority and challenging us to grapple with what equality really means in a world where people are born different. Weaving together personal stories with scientific evidence, Harden shows why our refusal to recognize the power of DNA perpetuates the myth of meritocracy, and argues that we must acknowledge the role of genetic luck if we are ever to create a fair society. Reclaiming genetic science from the legacy of eugenics, this groundbreaking book offers a bold new vision of society where everyone thrives, regardless of how one fares in the genetic lottery.||1 online resource||304.5|ebook - ebook|09/21/2021|2021-09-21|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780691226705?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WdoiEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Jeffrey Kluger.|The Narcissist Next Door|Kluger, Jeffrey|Kluger, Jeffrey.|Jeffrey Kluger|Nonfiction., Narcissism, Psychology., Self-Improvement., Electronic books., Electronic book|Psychology|A timely and provocative exploration of narcissism, from Donald Trump to Kanye West to Lance Armstrong, that shows us how to recognize and handle the narcissists we encounter every day.   Narcissists are everywhere. There are millions of them in the United States alone: politicians, entertainers, businesspeople, your neighbors. Recognizing and understanding them is crucial to your not being overtaken by them, says Jeffrey Kluger in his provocative book about this insidious disorder.  The odds are good that you know a narcissist-probably a lot of them. You see them in your office, on TV, maybe even in the mirror. The odds are also good that they are intelligent, confident, and articulate-the center of attention.  With intelligence, sight and wit, Kluger explains the startling new research into narcissism and the insights that research is yielding. He explains how narcissism and narcissists affect our lives at work and at home, on the road, and in the halls of government; what to do when we encounter narcissists; and how to neutralize narcissism's effects before it's too late. As a writer and editor at Time, Kluger knows how to take science's cutting-edge research and transform it into perceptive, accessible writing-which he does brilliantly in The Narcissist Next Door.

Management TodayIn the course of a couple of generations, South Koreans took themselves out of the paddy fields and into Silicon Valley, establishing themselves as a democracy alongside the advanced countries of the world. Yet for all their ambition and achievement, the new Koreans are a curiously self-deprecating people. Theirs is a land with a rich and complex past, certain aspects of which they would prefer to forget as they focus on the future.Having lived and worked in South Korea for many years, Michael Breen considers what drives the nation today, and where it is heading. Through insightful anecdotes and observations, he provides a compelling portrait of Asia's most contradictory and polarized country. South Koreans are motivated by defiance, Breen argues: defiance of their antagonistic neighbour, North Korea, of their own history and of international opinion. Here is an overlooked nation with, great drive, determined to succeed on its own terms.||1 online resource||306.095195|ebook - ebook|04/06/2017|2017-04-06|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781473550346?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zwPoDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Their country expanded, shrunk, split and sometimes disappeared, often under circumstances way beyond their control. Despite these often overwhelming pressures Vietnam has survived and is universally recognized as forming one of Asia's most striking and complex cultures.As more and more visitors come to this extraordinary country, there has been for some years a need for a major history - a book which allows the outsider to understand the many complex layers left by earlier emperors, rebels, priests and colonizers. Vietnam's role in one of the Cold War's longest conflicts has meant that its past has been endlessly abused for propaganda purposes and it is perhaps only now that the events which created the modern state can be seen through a truly historical perspective.Christopher Goscha is a leading expert on Vietnam, and this book draws on the latest research and discoveries in Vietnamese, French and English. It is a major achievement, describing both the grand narrative of Vietnam's story but also many of the remarkable byways and what ifs, and is particularly strong on the countless minority groups who have done so much over the centuries to define the many versions of Vietnam.||1 online resource||959.7|ebook - ebook|06/30/2016|2016-06-30|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780141946658?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kTVUCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Daymond John.|The Power of Broke|John, Daymond|John, Daymond.|Daymond John, Daniel Paisner|Nonfiction., Business., Self-Improvement., Electronic books., Electronic book|Business & Economics|Daymond John has been practicing the power of broke ever since he started selling his home-sewn t-shirts on the streets of Queens. With no funding and a $40 budget, Daymond had to come up with out-of-the box ways to promote his products. Luckily, desperation breeds innovation, and so he hatched an idea for a creative campaign that eventually launched the FUBU brand into a $6 billion dollar global phenomenon.  But it might not have happened if he hadn't started out broke - with nothing but a heart full of hope and a ferocious drive to succeed by any means possible. Here, the FUBU founder and star of ABC's Shark Tank shows that, far from being a liability, broke can actually be your greatest competitive advantage as an entrepreneur. Why?  Because starting a business from broke forces you to think more creatively.  It forces you to use your resources more efficiently. It forces you to connect with your customers more authentically, and market your ideas more imaginatively. It forces you to be true to yourself, stay laser focused on your goals, and come up with those innovative solutions required to make a meaningful mark.  Drawing his own experiences as an entrepreneur and branding consultant, peeks behind-the scenes from the set of Shark Tank, and stories of dozens of other entrepreneurs who have hustled their way to wealth, John shows how we can all leverage the power of broke to phenomenal success. You'll meet: ·         Steve Aoki, the electronic dance music (EDM) deejay who managed to parlay a series of $100 gigs into becoming a global superstar who has redefined the music industry  ·         Gigi Butler, a cleaning lady from Nashville who built cupcake empire on the back of a family  recipe, her maxed out credit cards, and a heaping dose of faith  ·         11-year old Shark Tank guest Mo Bridges who stitched together a winning clothing line with just his grandma's sewing machine, a stash of loose fabric, and his unique sartorial flairWhen your back is up against the wall, your bank account is empty, and creativity and passion are the only resources you can afford, success is your only option.

As Dr. Marian explains, while you may well think you speak only one language, in fact your mind accommodates multiple codes of communication. Some people speak Spanish, some Mandarin. Some speak poetry, some are fluent in math. The human brain is built to use multiple languages, and using more languages opens doors to creativity, brain health, and cognitive control.     Every new language we speak shapes how we extract and interpret information. It alters what we remember, how we perceive ourselves and the world around us, how we feel, the insights we have, the decisions we make, and the actions we take. Language is an invaluable tool for organizing, processing, and structuring information, and thereby unleashing radical advancement.     Learning a new language has broad lifetime consequences, and Dr. Marian reviews research showing that it:  ·        Enhances executive function-our ability to focus on the things that matter and ignore the things that don't.  ·        Results in higher scores on creative-thinking tasks.  ·        Develops critical reasoning skills.  ·        Delays Alzheimer's and other types of dementia by four to six years.  ·        Improves decisions made under emotional duress.  ·        Changes what we see, pay attention to, and recall.||1 online resource||401.9|ebook - ebook|04/04/2023|2023-04-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593187081?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WQp5EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Caldwell's odds-defying feat was the culmination of an entire lifetime of pushing himself to his limits as an athlete. This engrossing memoir chronicles the journey of a boy with a fanatical mountain-guide father who was determined to instill toughness in his son to a teen whose obsessive nature drove him to the top of the sport-climbing circuit. Caldwell's affinity for adventure then led him to the vertigo-inducing and little understood world of big wall free climbing. But his evolution as a climber was not without challenges; in his early twenties, he was held hostage by militants in a harrowing ordeal in the mountains of Kyrgyzstan. Soon after, he lost his left index finger in an accident. Later his wife, and main climbing partner, left him. Caldwell emerged from these hardships with a renewed sense of purpose and determination. He set his sights on free climbing El Capitan's biggest, steepest, blankest face-the Dawn Wall. This epic assault took more than seven years, during which time Caldwell redefined the sport, found love again, and became a father.  The Push is an arresting story of focus, drive, motivation, endurance, and transformation, a book that will appeal to anyone seeking to overcome fear and doubt, cultivate perseverance, turn failure into growth, and find connection with family and with the natural world.||1 online resource||796.522092|ebook - ebook|05/16/2017|2017-05-16|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780399562723?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dayNDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Steven G Mandis.|The Real Madrid Way|Mandis, Steven G.|Mandis, Steven G|Steven G. Mandis|Nonfiction., Soccer Social aspects, Soccer Economic aspects, Soccer, Business., Sports & Recreations., Spain Madrid, Electronic books.|Sports & Recreation|The untold story of Real Madrid: one of the most incredible turnarounds in sports and business history.Real Madrid is the most successful sports team on the planet. The soccer club has more trophies than any other sports team, including 11 UEFA Champions League trophies. However, the story behind the triumph goes beyond the players and coaches. Generally unnoticed, a management team consisting mostly of outsiders took the team from near bankruptcy to the most valuable sports organization in the world.How did Real Madrid achieve such extraordinary success? Columbia Business School adjunct professor Steven G. Mandis investigates. Given unprecedented behind-the-scenes access, Mandis is the first researcher to rigorously ana- lyze both the on-the-field and business aspects of a sports team. What he learns is completely unexpected and challenges the conventional wisdom that moneyball-fueled data analytics are the primary instruments of success. Instead, Real Madrid's winning formula both on and off the field, from player selection to financial management, is based on aligning strategy with the culture and values of its fan base.Chasing the most talented (and most expensive) players can be a recipe for a winning record, but also financial disaster, as it was for Real Madrid in the late 1990s. Real Madrid's management believes that the club exists to serve the Real Madrid community. They discovered that its fans care more about why the team exists, how their club wins, and whom it wins with versus just winning. The why, how, and whom create a community brand and identity, and inspire extraordinary passion and loyalty, which has led to amazing marketing and commercial success-in turn, attracting and paying for the best players in the world, with the values the fans expect. The club's values and culture also provide a powerful environment for these best players to work together to win trophies.The Real Madrid Way explains how Real Madrid has created and maintains a culture that drives both financial and on-the-field success. This book is an engrossing account of the lifetime of one of the greatest clubs in the most popular sport in the world, and for business and organization leaders, it's an invaluable inside look at a compelling alternative model with lasting competitive advantages that can deliver superior and sustainable returns and performance.||1 online resource||796.3340946|ebook - ebook|10/11/2016|2016-10-11|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781942952558?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IEbQDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Live in that zone you've glimpsed but can't seem to hold on to-the sweet spot where you have the greatest strength, but also the greatest ease. Not long ago, Christine Carter, a happiness expert at UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center and a speaker, writer, and mother, found herself exasperated by the busyness of modern life: too many conflicting obligations and not enough time, energy, or patience to get everything done. She tried all the standard techniques-prioritizing, multitasking, delegating, even napping-but none really worked. Determined to create a less stressful life for herself-without giving up her hard-won career success or happiness at home-she road-tested every research-based tactic that promised to bring more ease into her life.

Fu talismans are ideograms and writings typically rendered on paper and empowered by means of invocations, ritual, and transferences of energy, or Qi. Talismans can be used for many purposes, such as strengthening or weakening personality characteristics, finding love, earning more money, or easing emotional tensions in the home. The Tao of Craft shows how metaphysical energy can be harnessed to amplify, strengthen, weaken, dispel, or block other metaphysical energy and to rectify perceived imbalances in the material plane. Supported by an abundance of detailed charts and images, this book serves as a step-by-step handbook that gives readers the knowledge and confidence to craft their own Fu talismans for personal empowerment.  Wen, author of Holistic Tarot, delves into historic and cultural contexts of the Fu, from the neolithic period of Chinese history to contemporary practices of esoteric Taoism. Providing a solid foundation in the principles of Eastern spellcrafting, she highlights the blending of Taoist metaphysical practices with Western approaches to magic by pointing out eclectic, integrating, and harmonizing facets from other cultures and religions.   Historically, Fu talismans were used by medieval Chinese for alleviating illness; averting misfortune, magical attacks, and curses; defending against assaults; and avoiding poverty. This book shows western practitioners that the skill and knowledge to develop an interactive relationship with spirit realms are still available to them today, and serves as a practical handbook for accumulating Qi energy from sources in the environment and channeling it in concentrated form into their own Fu talismans.||1 online resource||299.51432|ebook - ebook|09/27/2016|2016-09-27|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781623170677?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nyQwCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Seldom does one find serious scholarship so easy to read. -  The Times , Book of the Year An instant  New York Times  bestseller, this major new history of the knights Templar is  a fresh, muscular and compelling history of the ultimate military-religious crusading order, combining sensible scholarship with narrative swagger  - Simon Sebag Montefiore, author of  Jerusalem       A faltering war in the middle east. A band of elite warriors determined to fight to the death to protect Christianity's holiest sites. A global financial network unaccountable to any government. A sinister plot founded on a web of lies.         Jerusalem 1119. A small group of knights seeking a purpose in the violent aftermath of the First Crusade decides to set up a new order. These are the first Knights Templar, a band of elite warriors prepared to give their lives to protect Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land. Over the next two hundred years, the Templars would become the most powerful religious order of the medieval world. Their legend has inspired fervent speculation ever since.  In this groundbreaking narrative history, Dan Jones tells the true story of the Templars for the first time in a generation, drawing on extensive original sources to build a gripping account of these Christian holy warriors whose heroism and alleged depravity have been shrouded in myth. The Templars were protected by the pope and sworn to strict vows of celibacy. They fought the forces of Islam in hand-to-hand combat on the sun-baked hills where Jesus lived and died, finding their nemesis in Saladin, who vowed to drive all Christians from the lands of Islam. Experts at channeling money across borders, they established the medieval world's largest and most innovative banking network and waged private wars against anyone who threatened their interests. Then, as they faced setbacks at the hands of the ruthless Mamluk sultan Baybars and were forced to retreat to their stronghold in Cyprus, a vindictive and cash-strapped King of France set his sights on their fortune. His administrators quietly mounted a damning case against the Templars, built on deliberate lies and false testimony. Then on Friday October 13, 1307, hundreds of brothers were arrested, imprisoned and tortured, and the order was disbanded amid lurid accusations of sexual misconduct and heresy. They were tried by the Pope in secret proceedings and their last master was brutally tortured and burned at the stake. But were they heretics or victims of a ruthlessly repressive state? Dan Jones goes back to the sources tobring their dramatic tale, so relevant to our own times, in a book that is at once authoritative and compulsively readable.||1 online resource||271.7913|ebook - ebook|09/19/2017|2017-09-19|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780698186439?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6RccDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The tiger isn't just killing people, it's annihilating them, and a team of men and their dogs must hunt it on foot through the forest in the brutal cold. As the trackers sift through the gruesome remains of the victims, they discover that these attacks aren't random: the tiger is apparently engaged in a vendetta.

After examining each issue and speaking with Palestinians and Israelis as well as negotiators directly involved in past summits, O'Malley concludes that even if such an agreement could be reached, it would be nearly impossible to implement given the staggering costs, Palestine's political disunity and the viability of its economy, rapidly changing demographics, Israel's continuing political shift to the right, global warming's effect on the water supply, and more.In this revelatory, hard-hitting book, O'Malley approaches the key issues pragmatically, without ideological bias, to show that we must find new frameworks for reconciliation if there is to be lasting peace between Palestine and Israel.From the Hardcover edition.||1 online resource||956.94054|ebook - ebook|07/28/2015|2015-07-28|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780698192188?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3_kVBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

To finish tasks and achieve goals, most people believe that more focus is the solution. We rely on to-do lists, calendar reminders, noise-blocking headphones, and sometimes medication to help us concentrate-even though these tactics often fail to substantially improve productivity. Drawing on the latest brain research, compelling stories from his psychological practice, and colorful examples of counterintuitive success from sports, business, education, and the arts, neuroscientist Srini Pillay, M.D., challenges traditional ideas about productivity, revealing the lasting, positive benefits of adding deliberate and regular unfocus to your repertoire. A fascinating tour through brain wavelengths and rhythm, mindsets, and mental relaxation, Tinker Dabble Doodle Try demonstrates how specific kinds of planned unfocus stimulate cognitive calmness, jumpstart productivity, enhance innovation, inspire creativity, improve long-term memory, and, of course, help you stay on target.  Tinkering with ideas and with things releases your mind to wander from a state of stuckness into a possibility frame of mind, triggering neural connections and new insights. Dabbling in a new endeavor-whether a hobby or fantasy-disrupts your habitual and reactive thinking, helping you find new solutions to old problems. Doodling can help you tap into another brain frequency to remove obstacles and create opportunities and inspiration. With techniques for training the brain to unfocus, concepts for scheduling busy lives, and ideas for controlling this new cognitive-toggling capability, Tinker Dabble Doodle Try will change how you think about daydreaming, relaxing, leaving work unfinished, and even multitasking. What you'll discover is a greater freedom, a deeper intelligence, and a more profound joy in your life.Advance praise for Tinker Dabble Doodle TryPillay's effortless writing style, combined with an excellent balance of popular psychology and self-help, makes this a helpful read for those who enjoy a light dive into psychology with practical applications.-Library JournalPillay cites an intriguing range of brain studies to support his argument, and his case studies of individuals with whom he has worked provide useful insights.-Kirkus Reviews Dr. Srini Pillay offers a brilliant, deeply researched, and even more deeply imagined blueprint for using one's full mental armamentarium, conscious, unconscious, and all the undiscovered rest!

In his characteristically direct, simple, and compassionate style, he explores the four key aspects of love as described in the Buddhist tradition: lovingkindness, compassion, joy, and freedom.  In order to love in a real way, Thich Nhat Hanh explains, we need to learn how to be fully present in our lives. In  True Love   he offers readers the technique of conscious breathing as a method for synchronizing the mind and body to establish the conditions of love. He goes on to offer a mantra practice for generating love that consists of expressing four key statements or intentions in our relationships. These include: Dear one, I am really there for you; Dear one, I know that you are there, and I am really happy about it; Dear one, I know that you are suffering, and that is why I am here for you; and Dear one, I am suffering, please help me.  In the concluding section of the book, Thich Nhat Hanh explains how love can help us to heal our own pain, fear, and negativity. He explains that we must not regard negative emotions as bad and repress them. We must recognize them as part of us and allow them into our consciousness, where they can be cared for by the loving mother of mindfulness.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|09/19/2023|2023-09-19|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780834845398?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W__HEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Asia that we see today is the product of the 'underground' which Harper describes with skill and empathy in this monumental work' Rana Mitter,  Literary Review    The story of the hidden struggle waged by secret networks around the world to destroy European imperialism   The end of Europe's empires has so often been seen as a story of high politics and warfare. In Tim Harper's remarkable new book the narrative is very different: it shows how empires were fundamentally undermined from below. Using the new technology of cheap printing presses, global travel and the widespread use of French and English, young radicals from across Asia were able to communicate in ways simply not available before. These clandestine networks stretched to the heart of the imperial metropolises: to London, to Paris, to the Americas, but also increasingly to Moscow. They created a secret global network which was for decades engaged in bitter fighting with imperial police forces. They gathered in the great hubs of Asia - Calcutta, Singapore, Batavia, Hanoi, Tokyo, Shanghai, Canton and Hong Kong - and plotted with ceaseless ingenuity, both through persuasion and terrorism, the end of the colonial regimes. Many were caught and killed or imprisoned, but others would go on to rule their newly independent countries. Drawing on an amazing array of new sources,  Underground Asia  turns upside-down our understanding of twentieth-century empire. The reader enters an extraordinary world of stowaways, false identities, secret codes, cheap firearms, assassinations and conspiracies, as young Asians made their own plans for their future.

She's also a successful actor who has written a barrage of thoughtful essays published by the likes of the  New York Times . If you ask her, though, she's a total fraud. She'd hate to admit it, but no one does impostor syndrome quite like Aparna Nancherla. UNRELIABLE NARRATOR is a collection of essays that uses Aparna's signature humor to illuminate an interior life, one constantly bossed around by her depression (whom she calls Brenda), laced with anxiety like a horror movie full of jump-scares, and plagued by an unrepenting love-hate relationship with her career as a painfully shy standup comedian. But luckily, crippling self-doubt comes with the gift of keen self-examination. These essays deliver hilarious and incredibly insightful meditations on body image, productivity culture, the ultra-meme-ability of mental health language, and who, exactly, gets to make art about nothing. Despite her own arguments to the contrary, UNRELIABLE NARRATOR is undeniable proof that Aparna is a force-as a comedian and author alike-to be reckoned with.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|09/19/2023|2023-09-19|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781984879813?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ruqfEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is the most popular personality test in the world. It has been harnessed by Fortune 100 companies, universities, hospitals, churches, and the military. Its language – of extraversion vs. introversion, thinking vs. feeling – has inspired online dating platforms and Buzzfeed quizzes alike. And yet despite the test's widespread adoption, experts in the field of psychometric testing, a $500 million industry, struggle to account for its success – no less validate its results. How did the Myers-Briggs insinuate itself into our jobs, our relationships, our internet, our lives? First conceived in the 1920s by the mother-daughter team of Katherine Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers, a pair of aspiring novelists and devoted homemakers, the Myers-Briggs was designed to bring the gospel of Carl Jung to the masses. But it would take on a life of its own, reaching from the smoke-filled boardrooms of mid-century New York to Berkeley, California, where it was honed against some of the 20th century's greatest creative minds. It would travel across the world to London, Zurich, Cape Town, Melbourne, and Tokyo; to elementary schools, nunneries, wellness retreats, and the closed-door corporate training sessions of today. Drawing from original reporting and never-before-published documents, What's Your Type? examines nothing less than the definition of the self – our attempts to grasp, categorise and quantify our personalities. Surprising and absorbing, the book, like the test at its heart, considers the timeless question: What makes you you?||1 online resource||155.264|ebook - ebook|09/11/2018|2018-09-11|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008201395?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bHFNDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

These are not easy questions, and in reality, you will never know the answers completely until you see our Lord face to face in heaven. Nevertheless, the Bible does give you some answers.  Who's in Charge of a World that Suffers? includes an informative and inspirational new introduction by Franklin Graham that speaks to today's reader in the midst of painful circumstances.  In this book, originally titled Till Armageddon, world-renowned evangelist Billy Graham uncovers the clues the scriptures offer you to this universal question-the question of suffering. Readers will discover what the Bible says about:   Why Christians are not exempt from suffering  Living above your circumstances  The place of prayer in suffering  God's promises for those who suffer  And much more  Christians are called to learn what it means to trust God in every circumstance, and to live for Him no matter what comes our way. It is essential to think more clearly about suffering, and to rearrange your priorities so that when your personal armageddons come, you will not be taken by surprise or be unprepared.

And as the tournament's official ambassador, Pelé is ready to be the face of progress.  For the first time ever Pelé explores the recent history of the game and provides new insights into soccer's role connecting and galvanizing players around the world.

In groundbreaking detail and with unparalleled openness, he shares his most inspiring experiences, heartwarming stories and hard-won wisdom, and he puts the game in perspective.

Scott Barry Kaufman.|Wired to Create|Kaufman, Scott Barry|Kaufman, Scott Barry.|Scott Barry Kaufman, PhD, Carolyn Gregoire|Nonfiction., Psychology., Self-Improvement., Electronic books., Electronic book|Self-Help|Discover the ten things highly creative people do differently.  Is it possible to make sense of something as elusive as creativity? Based on psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman's groundbreaking research and Carolyn Gregoire's popular article in the Huffington Post, Wired to Create offers a glimpse inside the messy minds of highly creative people. Revealing the latest findings in neuroscience and psychology, along with engaging examples of artists and innovators throughout history, the book shines a light on the practices and habits of mind that promote creative thinking. Kaufman and Gregoire untangle a series of paradoxes&#8212; like mindfulness and daydreaming, seriousness and play, openness and sensitivity, and solitude and collaboration &#8211; to show that it is by embracing our own contradictions that we are able to tap into our deepest creativity. Each chapter explores one of the ten attributes and habits of highly creative people:  Imaginative Play * Passion * Daydreaming * Solitude * Intuition * Openness to Experience * Mindfulness * Sensitivity * Turning Adversity into Advantage * Thinking Differently With insights from the work and lives of Pablo Picasso, Frida Kahlo, Marcel Proust, David Foster Wallace, Thomas Edison, Josephine Baker, John Lennon, Michael Jackson, musician Thom Yorke, chess champion Josh Waitzkin, video-game designer Shigeru Miyamoto, and many other creative luminaries, Wired to Create helps us better understand creativity &#8211; and shows us how to enrich this essential aspect of our lives.

Using the same inspired structure of alternating voices, Chris and Harry have recast material specifically for women, who already live longer and take better care of themselves than men. New material covers menopause and post-menopause, as well as cardiac disease, osteoporosis, sexuality, and more. This is the book that can show us how to turn back our biological clocks-how to put off 70% of the normal problems of aging (weakness, sore joints, bad balance) and eliminate 50% of serious illness and injury. The key to the program is found in Harry's Rules: Exercise six days a week. Don't eat crap. Connect and commit to others. There are seven rules all together, based on the latest findings in cell physiology, evolutionary biology, anthropology, and experimental psychology. Dr. Lodge explains how and why they work-and Chris Crowley, who is living proof of their effectiveness (skiing better today, for example, than he did twenty years ago), gives the just-as-essential motivation.Both men and women can become functionally younger every year for the next five to ten years, then continue to live with newfound vitality and pleasure deep into our 80s and beyond.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|05/03/2010|2007-10-10|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780761153801?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a9qVWUX8GZAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The working title for the movie is The Irishman.Updated with a 57-page Conclusion by the author that features new, independent corroboration of Frank Sheeran's revelations about the killing of Jimmy Hoffa, the killing of Joey Gallo and the murder of JFK, along with stories that could not be told before.The first words Jimmy Hoffa ever spoke to Frank the Irishman Sheeran were, I heard you paint houses. To paint a house is to kill a man. The paint is the blood that splatters on the walls and floors. In the course of nearly five years of recorded interviews Frank Sheeran confessed to Charles Brandt that he handled more than twenty-five hits for the mob, and for his friend Hoffa. Sheeran learned to kill in the U.S. Army, where he saw an astonishing 411 days of active combat duty in Italy during World War II. After returning home he became a hustler and hit man, working for legendary crime boss Russell Bufalino. Eventually he would rise to a position of such prominence that in a RICO suit then-U.S. Attorney Rudy Giuliani would name him as one of only two non-Italians on a list of 26 top mob figures. When Bufalino ordered Sheeran to kill Hoffa, he did the deed, knowing that if he had refused he would have been killed himself. Sheeran's important and fascinating story includes new information on other famous murders including those of Joey Gallo and JFK, and provides rare insight to a chapter in American history. Charles Brandt has written a page-turner that has become a true crime classic.||1 online resource||364.106|ebook - ebook|06/24/2016|2016-06-24|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781586422400?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kipLDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It traces the development of the subject throughout the centuries, starting with the so-called Lebombo bone, the oldest known mathematical object that was estimated to be at least 43,000 years old, and ending with the 21st century.The presentation is informal, and no prior knowledge of mathematics is needed to enjoy the systematic chronological insights. A collection of appendices is included for more technical material — though still at the level of secondary school mathematics — and is concerned with the historically important proofs and concepts that can be explained in a simple way.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|11/17/2023||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9789811280450?s=MD|

Shechen Gyaltsap.|A Chariot to Freedom|Gyaltsap Gyurme Pema Namgyal, Schechen|Gyaltsap, Shechen.|Shechen Gyaltsap Gyurme Pema Namgyal|Nonfiction., Religion & Spirituality., Electronic books.|Religion|A unique commentary on the preliminary practices of Vajrayāna Buddhism, from a beloved Nyingma master.     A Chariot to Freedom  is one of the most beloved presentations of the preliminary practices, or  ngöndro , that form the foundation of the Vajrayāna Buddhist path. This set of practices, common to all schools of Himalayan Buddhism, is what nearly every practitioner begins with, yet it also constitutes a complete method in and of itself. Although  ngöndro  are considered a prerequisite for further teachings and initiations into other practices, many of even the most accomplished masters continue to engage in them every day.  Most of the other excellent works on these foundational techniques are specific to a particular tradition, but this text is widely considered to be exemplary, in part, because it is applicable to all traditions of  ngöndro . Drawing from the original words of the Buddha in the sūtras and from later treatises by such masters as Nāgārjuna, Shāntideva, and Guru Padmasambhava, Shechen Gyaltsap's commentary is a wonderfully curated anthology of Buddhist teachings on the preliminary practices of Vajrayāna Buddhism. It covers the thoughts that turn one's mind away from ordinary pursuits and toward enlightenment, taking refuge, arousing the mind set on enlightenment (bodhichitta), purification, maṇḍala offering, and Guru Yoga.  Shechen Gyaltsap explains why each practice is beneficial and provides profound and eminently useful guidance for practitioners, while simultaneously transmitting the wisdom of generations of Buddhist masters.||1 online resource||294.3925|ebook - ebook|12/28/2021|2021-12-28|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780834843820?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PLFCEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Kartik Hosanagar.|A Human's Guide to Machine Intelligence|Hosanagar, Kartik|Hosanagar, Kartik.|Kartik Hosanagar|Nonfiction., Business., Computer Technology., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|A Wharton professor and tech entrepreneur examines how algorithms and artificial intelligence are starting to run every aspect of our lives, and how we can shape the way they impact us  Through the technology embedded in almost every major tech platform and every web-enabled device, algorithms and the artificial intelligence that underlies them make a staggering number of everyday decisions for us, from what products we buy, to where we decide to eat, to how we consume our news, to whom we date, and how we find a job. We've even delegated life-and-death decisions to algorithms—decisions once made by doctors, pilots, and judges. In his new book, Kartik Hosanagar surveys the brave new world of algorithmic decision-making and reveals the potentially dangerous biases they can give rise to as they increasingly run our lives. He makes the compelling case that we need to arm ourselves with a better, deeper, more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon of algorithmic thinking. And he gives us a route in, pointing out that algorithms often think a lot like their creators—that is, like you and me. Hosanagar draws on his experiences designing algorithms professionally—as well as on history, computer science, and psychology—to explore how algorithms work and why they occasionally go rogue, what drives our trust in them, and the many ramifications of algorithmic decision-making. He examines episodes like Microsoft's chatbot Tay, which was designed to converse on social media like a teenage girl, but instead turned sexist and racist; the fatal accidents of self-driving cars; and even our own common, and often frustrating, experiences on services like Netflix and Amazon.  A Human's Guide to Machine Intelligence  is an entertaining and provocative look at one of the most important developments of our time and a practical user's guide to this first wave of practical artificial intelligence.||1 online resource||006.31|ebook - ebook|03/12/2019|2019-03-12|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780525560890?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tztgDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

We are at a tipping point in retail history. While consumers are profiting from the convenience of instant gratification, rapidly advancing technologies are transforming the way goods are transported and displacing workers in ways never before seen.  In Arriving Today, Christopher Mims goes deep, far, and wide to uncover how a single product, from creation to delivery, weaves its way from a factory on the other side of the world to our doorstep. He analyzes the evolving technologies and management strategies necessary to keep the product moving to fulfill consumers' demand for arriving today gratification. Mims reveals a world where the only thing moving faster than goods in an Amazon warehouse is the rate at which an entire industry is being gutted and rebuilt by innovation and mass shifts in human labor practices. He goes behind the scenes to uncover the paradoxes in this shift-into the world's busiest port, the cabin of an 18-wheeler, and Amazon's automated warehouses-to explore how the promise of arriving today is fulfilled through a balletic dance between humans and machines.   The scope of such large-scale innovation and expended energy is equal parts inspiring, enlightening, and horrifying. As he offers a glimpse of our future, Mims asks us to consider the system's vulnerability and its resilience, and who shoulders the burden, as we hurtle toward a fully automated system-and what it will mean when we are there.||1 online resource||388.044|ebook - ebook|09/14/2021|2021-09-14|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062987969?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0AEXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Do you have a fear of rejection? If so, you aren't alone. But if you have difficulty bouncing back after rejection, experience intense pain as a result, or if the fear of rejection is so crippling that it interferes with your everyday life, it's time to make a change. This groundbreaking guide can help.  With this book, you'll learn  why  you fear rejection by gaining an understanding of your unique  attachment style . Secure attachment is defined as a feeling of being protected and well-cared for. People who experience secure attachment as young children are more likely to be happy, healthy, and resilient adults. On the other hand, insecurely attached people are less likely to cope well with rejection, and may have trouble bouncing back after difficult experiences. Once you understand how your attachment style has informed your fears, you can begin the work needed to overcome them!  Using the theory of attachment, and the five domains of awareness: Sensations, Thoughts, Emotions, Actions, and Mentalizing (STEAM), you'll learn to relate to yourself and to others in more positive ways, even when difficult situations arise. So, whether you experience rejection in a romantic relationship, at work, or with friends, you'll have the resilience needed to recover quickly and focus on what makes you special and unique.  This isn't a book that promises to protect you from future rejection. Unfortunately, rejection happens to everyone and is a normal part of life. But you  will  learn skills to handle this rejection and come to see it as less scary. With this view, you'll gain confidence, self-awareness, and the resilience needed to bounce back, even when life throws you a curveball.||1 online resource||158.1|ebook - ebook|12/01/2019|2019-12-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781684034031?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6xKaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Gone. Anxiety? Gone. All without medication. Unpleasant side effects from blood pressure pills? Gone. A cheap and effective way to combat cardiovascular disease, immune dysfunction, obesity, and GI disorders? Yes. Sounds too good to be true? Believe it.Contemporary science confirms what generations of healers have observed through centuries of practice: Breath awareness can turn on the body's natural abilities to prevent and cure illness. The mental and physical stresses of modern life, such as anxiety, frustration, sexual dysfunction, insomnia, high blood pressure, digestive woes, and immune dysfunction can all be addressed through conscious control of your breath. In addition, it can increase energy, accelerate healing, improve cognitive skills, and enhance mental balance.Yet most of us stopped breathing in the anatomically right way, the way to take advantage of these benefits, when we were four or five years old. We now mostly breathe in a way that is anatomically incongruous and makes for more illness. Dr. Vranich shows readers how to turn back the tide of stress and illness, and improve the overall quality of their life through a daily breathing workout. In a fascinating, straightforward, jargon-free exploration of how our bodies were meant to breathe, Dr. Belisa Vranich delves into the ins and outs of proper breathing. By combining both anatomy and fitness with psychology and mindfulness, Dr. Vranich gives readers a way of solving health problems at the crux and healing themselves from the inside out.

Managing for the first time is even harder.   A new start-up comes on the scene filled with a team of talented people. The start-up grows, the team expands, and those early joiners all of a sudden are responsible for leading a team. Just a few years prior, these folks were barely able to figure out their own roles in their crazy, ever-changing company. Now, as managers, they are expected-often without any direction or role models-to know how to develop, coach, structure projects, review, and set expectations for a whole bunch of new, incredible people.   First-timers want to quickly learn what it takes to be a successful manager-like they learned how to code, how to design, how to sell-and put those learnings into practice. But what does it mean to manage, and how do you teach someone to be a good manager? Enter Rachel Pacheco, an expert at helping start-ups solve their management and culture challenges. Pacheco, a former chief people officer and founding team executive at multiple start-ups, conducts research on management and works with CEOs and their managers to build the skills necessary to navigate a rapidly scaling organization.   In  Bringing Up the Boss: Practical Lessons for New Managers , Pacheco shares these skills, along with cutting-edge research, data, anecdotes, how-to exercises, and more, to help overwhelmed employees become expert managers.||1 online resource||658.302|ebook - ebook|08/10/2021|2021-08-10|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781953295408?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p_0xEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Reward and recognition programs can be costly and inefficient, and they primarily reward employees who are already highly engaged and productive performers. Worse still, these programs actually decrease employee motivation because they can make individual recognition, rather than the overall success of the team, the goal. Yet many businesses turn to these measures first-unaware of a better alternative. So, when it comes to changing your organizational culture, carrots and sticks don't work! What does work is Dr. Paul Marciano's acclaimed RESPECT model, which gives you specific, low-cost, turnkey solutions and action plans- based on seven key drivers of employee engagement that are proven and supported by decades of research and practice-that will empower you to assess, troubleshoot, and resolve engagement issues in the workplace:Recognition and acknowledgment of employees' contributionsEmpowerment via tools, resources, and information that set employees up to succeedSupportive feedback through ongoing performance coaching and mentoringPartnering to encourage and foster collaborative working relationshipsExpectations that set clear, challenging, and attainable performance goalsConsideration that lets employees know that they are cared aboutTrust in your employees' abilities, skills, and judgment Carrots and Sticks Don't Work delivers the same proven resources and techniques that have enabled trainers, executives, managers, and owners at operations ranging from branches of the United States government to Fortune 500 corporations to twenty-person outfits to realize demonstrable gains in employee productivity and job satisfaction.

Kristof|Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., Travel., Electronic books.|Biography & Autobiography|From  New York Times  columnist, Pulitzer Prize winner, and best-selling author Nicholas D. Kristof, an intimate and gripping memoir about a life in journalism “Nick Kristof takes us behind the scenes as he risks his life to shine a light on the world’s most pressing problems and blaze a trail to a better future. In a time when trust in journalism is in jeopardy, his honesty, humility, and humanity are rays of hope.”—Adam Grant, author of  Hidden Potential   Since 1984, Nicholas Kristof has worked almost continuously for  The New York Times  as a reporter, foreign correspondent, bureau chief, and now columnist, becoming one of the foremost reporters of his generation. Here, he recounts his event-filled path from a small-town farm in Oregon to every corner of the world. Reporting from Hong Kong, Beijing, and Tokyo, while traveling far afield to India, Africa, and Europe, Kristof witnessed and wrote about century-defining events: the Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, the Yemeni civil war, the Darfur genocide in Sudan, and the wave of addiction and despair that swept through his hometown and a broad swath of working-class America. Fully aware that coverage of atrocities generates considerably fewer page views than the coverage of politics, he nevertheless continued to weaponize his pen against regimes and groups violating basic human rights, raising the cost of oppression and torture. Some of the risks he took while doing so make for hair-raising reading. Kristof writes about some of the great members of his profession and introduces us to extraordinary people he has met, such as the dissident whom he helped escape from China and a Catholic nun who browbeat a warlord into releasing schoolgirls he had kidnapped. These are the people, the heroes, who have allowed Kristof to remain optimistic. Side by side with the worst of humanity, you always see the best. This is a candid memoir of vulnerability and courage, humility and purpose, mistakes and learning—a singular tale of the trials, tribulations, and hope to be found in a life dedicated to the pursuit of truth.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|05/14/2024|2024-05-14|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593536575?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MODQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

He clearly explains the methods and tools he uses to reconfigure unworkable cityscapes into the landscapes he believes they should be: cities for people.Taking into account changing demographics and changing lifestyles, Gehl emphasizes four human issues that he sees as essential to successful city planning. He explains how to develop cities that are Lively, Safe, Sustainable, and Healthy. Focusing on these issues leads Gehl to think of even the largest city on a very small scale. For Gehl, the urban landscape must be considered through the five human senses and experienced at the speed of walking rather than at the speed of riding in a car or bus or train. This small-scale view, he argues, is too frequently neglected in contemporary projects.In a final chapter, Gehl makes a plea for city planning on a human scale in the fast- growing cities of developing countries. A Toolbox, presenting key principles, overviews of methods, and keyword lists, concludes the book.The book is extensively illustrated with over 700 photos and drawings of examples from Gehl's work around the globe.||1 online resource||307.1216|ebook - ebook|03/05/2013|2013-03-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781597269841?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lBNJoNILqQcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

But this obsessive focus was a major cause of the abuses that nearly sunk the global economy in 2008. In this analytically rigorous and eminently practical book, Bruno Roche and Jay Jakub offer a more complete form of capitalism, one that delivers superior financial performance precisely because it mobilizes and generates human, social, and natural capital along with financial capital. They describe how the model has been implemented in live business pilots in Africa, Asia, and elsewhere. Recent high-profile books like Capital in the Twenty-First Century have exposed financial capitalism's shortcomings, but this book goes far beyond by describing a well-developed, field-tested alternative.||1 online resource||330.122|ebook - ebook|04/14/2022|2017-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781626569287?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t2TEDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

He had left a cushy yet suffocating job at a law firm to try his hand at the high-risk life of a proprietary trader - and he did pretty well for himself. But it all came crashing down in the wee hours of November 5, 2009, when the Feds came to his door-almost taking the door off its hinges. While his wife and children were sequestered to a bedroom, Kimelman was marched off in embarrassment in view of his neighbors and TV crews who had been alerted in advance. He was arrested as part of a huge insider trading case, and while he was offered a �sweetheart no-jail probation plea, he refused, maintaining his innocence.The lion's share of Confessions of a Wall Street Insider was written while Kimelman was an inmate at Lewisburg Penitentiary. In nearly two years behind bars, he reflected on his experiences before incarceration-rubbing elbows and throwing back far too many cocktails with financial titans and major figures in sports and entertainment (including Leonardo DiCaprio, Alex Rodriguez, Ben Bernanke, and Alan Greenspan, to drop a few names); making and losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in daily gambles on the Street; getting involved with the wrong people, who eventually turned on him; realizing that none of that mattered in the end. As he writes: �Stripped of family, friends, time, and humanity, if there's ever a place to give one pause, it's prison . . . Tomorrow is promised to no one. In Confessions of a Wall Street Insider, he reveals the triumphs, pains, and struggles, and how, in the end, it just might have made him a better person.Skyhorse Publishing, along with our Arcade, Good Books, Sports Publishing, and Yucca imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of biographies, autobiographies, and memoirs.

For years, Joyce has been helping women better identify emotional barriers and physical, mental, and spiritual obstacles in their lives. Now she provides another answer: Confidence. Our society has an insecurity epidemic. Women in particular compensate by pretending to be secure-a common response-which only leads to feelings of shame. Lack of self-confidence causes great difficulty in relationships of all kinds, and can even lead to divorce. In  Confidently You , Joyce explores the characteristics of a woman with confidence, which include a woman who knows she is loved, who refuses to live in fear, and who does not live by comparisons. Joyce explains that confidence stems from being positive in your actions and living honestly, but most importantly from having faith in God and in ourselves.  Derived from material previously published in  The Confident Woman .||1 online resource||248.843|ebook - ebook|07/26/2022|2022-07-26|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781546015482?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YR9NEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Claire-Michelle Smyth.|Contract Law|Smyth, Claire-Michelle|Smyth, Claire-Michelle.|Claire-Michelle Smyth, Marcus Gatto|Nonfiction., Business., Electronic books., Electronic book|Business & Economics|This text serves as an accessible introduction to the law of contract. The headings chosen for examination track the main points in the lifetime of a contract-from its formation, drafting, and onward to its eventual dissolution, whether this occurs due to the terms of the contract, the will of the parties, or because of a breach of the agreed terms. It also provides studies of other notable areas within the subject, such as third-party rights, damages, and equitable remedies. In distinction to other guides to contract law, this text provides a comparative analysis of the area, incorporating sources drawn from both the civil law tradition, characteristic of several nations within Continental Europe, as well as the Anglo-American common law tradition, with cases and legislation drawn from England and the United States of America. It also explores contract law in the unique context of so-called hybrid jurisdictions-those that incorporate elements of both the common law and civilian traditions. As business assumes a global dimension, knowledge of the operation of contract law across various legal traditions and national contexts is increasingly at a premium. This text enables the student to gain a coherent vision of contract law, as well as to speak confidently when discussing the intricacies of the subject.||1 online resource||346.7302|ebook - ebook|07/09/2018|2018-07-09|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781631579288?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dmljDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

How far would you go to protect yourself? Your dignity? Your family? In the days before Homeira Qaderi gave birth to her son, Siawash, the road to the hospital in Kabul would often be barricaded because of the frequent suicide explosions. With the city and the military on edge, it was not uncommon for an armed soldier to point his gun at the pregnant woman's bulging stomach, terrified that she was hiding a bomb. Propelled by the love she held for her soon-to-be-born child, Homeira walked through blood and wreckage to reach the hospital doors. But the joy of her beautiful son's birth was soon overshadowed by other dangers that would threaten her life. No ordinary Afghan woman, Homeira refused to cower under the strictures of a misogynistic social order. Defying the law, at the age of thirteen, she risked her freedom to teach children reading and writing and fought for women's rights in her theocratic and patriarchal society. Devastating in its power, Dancing in the Mosque is a mother's searing letter to the son she was forced to leave behind. In telling her story - and that of Afghan women - Homeira challenges us to reconsider the meaning of motherhood, sacrifice, and survival.||1 online resource||958.1046|ebook - ebook|12/01/2020|2020-12-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008375294?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7frgDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Steve Coll.|Directorate S|Coll, Steve|Coll, Steve.|Steve Coll|Nonfiction., History., Politics., Electronic books.|Political Science|Resuming the narrative of his Pulitzer Prize-winning Ghost Wars, bestselling author Steve Coll tells for the first time the epic and enthralling story of America's intelligence, military, and diplomatic efforts to defeat Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan since 9/11Prior to 9/11, the United States had been carrying out small-scale covert operations in Afghanistan, ostensibly in cooperation, although often in direct opposition, with I.S.I., the Pakistani intelligence agency. While the US was trying to quell extremists, a highly secretive and compartmentalized wing of I.S.I., known as Directorate S, was covertly training, arming, and seeking to legitimize the Taliban, in order to enlarge Pakistan's sphere of influence. After 9/11, when fifty-nine countries, led by the U. S., deployed troops or provided aid to Afghanistan in an effort to flush out the Taliban and Al Qaeda, the U.S. was set on an invisible slow-motion collision course with Pakistan.Today we know that the war in Afghanistan would falter badly because of military hubris at the highest levels of the Pentagon, the drain on resources and provocation in Muslim world caused by the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, and corruption. But more than anything, as Coll makes painfully clear, the war in Afghanistan was doomed because of the failure of the United States to apprehend the motivations and intentions of I.S.I.'s Directorate S. This was a swirling and shadowy struggle of historic proportions, which endured over a decade and across both the Bush and Obama administrations, involving multiple secret intelligence agencies, a litany of incongruous strategies and tactics, and dozens of players, including some of the most prominent military and political figures. A sprawling American tragedy, the war was an open clash of arms but also a covert melee of ideas, secrets, and subterranean violence. Coll excavates this grand battle, which took place away from the gaze of the American public. With unsurpassed expertise, original research, and attention to detail, he brings to life a narrative at once vast and intricate, local and global, propulsive and painstaking. This is the definitive explanation of how America came to be so badly ensnared in an elaborate, factional, and seemingly interminable conflict in South Asia.

He chronicles the torture of finding a job before the internet when you had to talk on the phone  all  the time, and fantasizes, as we all do, about who to tell off when he finally wins an Oscar. As Gary himself says, These are essays from my childhood and young adulthood about things that still annoy me.

Today, more than ever, companies need to innovate to survive. But successful innovation-measured in dollars and cents-is a very hard target to hit.  Companies obsess over being creative and innovative and spend significant time and expense in designing and building products, yet struggle to monetize them: 72% of innovations fail to meet their financial targets-or fail entirely. Many companies have come to accept that a high failure rate, and the billions of dollars lost annually, is just the cost of doing business. Monetizing Innovations argues that this is tragic, wasteful, and wrong. Radically improving the odds that your innovation will succeed is just a matter of removing the guesswork. That happens when you put customer demand and willingness to pay in the driver seat-when you design the product around the price. It's a new paradigm, and that opens the door to true game change: You can stop hoping to monetize, and start knowing that you will. The authors at Simon Kucher know what they're talking about. As the world's premier pricing and monetization consulting services company, with 800 professionals in 30 cities around the globe, they have helped clients ranging from massive pharmaceuticals to fast-growing startups find success. In Monetizing Innovation, they distil the lessons of thirty years and over 10,000 projects into a practical, nine-step approach. Whether you are a CEO, executive leadership, or part of the team responsible for innovation and new product development, this book is for you, with special sections and checklist-driven summaries to make monetizing innovation part of your company's DNA. Illustrative case studies show how some of the world's best innovative companies like LinkedIn, Uber, Porsche, Optimizely, Draeger, Swarovski and big pharmaceutical companies have used principles outlined in this book. A direct challenge to the status quo spray and pray style of innovation, Monetizing Innovation presents a practical approach that can be adopted by any organization, in any industry. Most monetizing innovation failure point home. Now more than ever, companies must rethink the practices that have lost countless billions of dollars. Monetizing Innovation presents a new way forward, and a clear promise: Go from hope to certainty.||1 online resource||658.5752|ebook - ebook|05/02/2016|2016-05-02|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781119240877?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y0EbDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Fatal conveniences are the toxic products we routinely use and the unhealthy things we do that our culture and corporations have made us believe are safe and necessary for living well and efficiently. These things-from deodorant, cosmetics, dental floss, and sunscreen to laundry detergent, air fresheners, carpets, and crayons to candles, tea bags, cell phones, and chewing gum-are ubiquitous in daily life . . . and they are wreaking havoc on our health and our planet. The environmental toxins found in these products create a cascade of problems, including chemical sensitivities, auto-immune issues, obesity, chronic health diseases, and more.   Darin Olien has spent most of his adult life obsessively researching these conveniences and in this book, he raises our awareness of their dangers, demolishes the myth that if it's easy, it must also be good, and gives us alternative choices to take control of our lives and our health.

Sebastian|Organizational change., Success in business., Information technology Management., Business enterprises Technological innovations., Business enterprises Technological innovations., Information technology Management., Organizational change., Success in business., Electronic books., Weill, Peter, author., Sebastian, Ina M., author.|Business & Economics|To be a top performer in the digital economy-to become truly  future ready -you need a playbook. Now you have one.   It seems like almost every company you can think of-including your own-has embarked on a digital transformation journey. The problem is, many companies start down the road without a good sense of where they are going or a clear idea of how they will create and capture digital value. Not surprisingly, this leads to problems: failure to realize the value from digital in their bottom lines, wasted resources and effort, added complexity and dysfunction.  This compact, no-nonsense book provides a solution. In their years of working with senior executives around the world, MIT research scientists Stephanie Woerner, Peter Weill, and Ina Sebastian noticed that these leaders knew they had to transform their businesses, but lacked a coherent framework and a common language-a playbook-to guide and motivate their employees and keep everyone focused on a common goal.   Future Ready  is that playbook. Based on years of rigorous research with data from more than a thousand companies-BBVA, CEMEX, DBS, Fidelity, Maersk, and many others-the book provides a powerful, field-tested four pathways framework that offers insights into the important dimensions at which a firm must excel in order to be competitive, as well as the organizational disruptions that every firm must manage as part of the transformation journey.  The book includes instructive examples, sharp analyses, assessments to help companies benchmark themselves against top performers, and many illuminating visuals to help crystallize the data and ideas.    Woerner, Weill, and Sebastian show that the goal isn't digital transformation but rather a profound  business  transformation.  Future Ready  is your essential guide for becoming a top performer in the digital economy.||1 online resource||658.406|ebook - ebook|10/18/2022|2022-10-18|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781647823504?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8alYEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

When Dave Asprey started his Bulletproof Radio podcast more than five years ago, he sought out thought leaders and influencers in an array of disciplines, from biochemists to business titans to mediation masters. These folks were some of the top performing humans in the world, people who had changed their areas of study or even pioneered entirely new fields. Dave wanted to know: What did they have in common? What mattered most to them? What makes them so successful at what they do-and what makes them happiest? And so, at the end of each interview, Dave began asking the same question: What are your top three recommendations for people who want to kick more ass?Combing through the recordings, looking for patterns and common threads, he found that the wisdom gleaned from these highly successful people can be distilled into three main categories: body, mind, and spirit. Game Changers is the culmination of Dave's years-long statistical analysis of these conversations, offering thirty-six science-backed, high performance laws that are a virtual playbook for how to become not only more successful, but also happier and healthier.Each chapter of Game Changers is structured around one of these laws. Dave combines anecdotes from game changers like Daniel Amen, David Perlmutter, Arianna Huffington, Dan Harris, and Tim Ferris with his own research and practical advice that readers can put into action immediately. From practising gratitude and mindfulness to prioritising social connections and sex, taming fear and anxiety to optimising nutrition and movement, Dave brings together the wisdom of today's game-changers to help everyone optimise their lives.||1 online resource||158.1|ebook - ebook|12/24/2018|2018-12-24|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780008318642?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CIRgDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Over the years, Ury has discovered that the greatest obstacle to successful agreements and satisfying relationships is not the other side, as difficult as they can be. The biggest obstacle is actually our own selves—our natural tendency to react in ways that do not serve our true interests.But this obstacle can also become our biggest opportunity, Ury argues. If we learn to understand and influence ourselves first, we lay the groundwork for understanding and influencing others. In this prequel to Getting to Yes, Ury offers a seven-step method to help you reach agreement with yourself first, dramatically improving your ability to negotiate with others.Practical and effective, Getting to Yes with Yourself helps readers reach good agreements with others, develop healthy relationships, make their businesses more productive, and live far more satisfying lives.||1 online resource||158.1|ebook - ebook|01/20/2015|2015-01-20|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062363398?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q6DXBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Frederic Lenoir.|Happiness|Lenoir, Frederic|Lenoir, Frederic.|Frederic Lenoir|Nonfiction., Essays., Philosophy., Self-Improvement., Electronic books., Electronic book|Self-Help|A huge bestseller in Europe, Frederic Lenoir's Happiness is an exciting journey that examines how history's greatest philosophers and religious figures have answered life's most fundamental question: What is happiness and how do I achieve it? From the ancient Greeks on—from Aristotle, Plato, and Chuang Tzu to the Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad; from Voltaire, Spinoza, and Schopenhauer to Kant, Freud, and even modern neuroscientists—Lenoir considers the idea that true and lasting happiness is indeed possible. In clear language, Lenoir concisely surveys what the greatest thinkers of all time have had to say on the subject, and, with charming prose, raises provocative questions:   · Do we have a duty to be happy?  · Is there a connection between individual and collective happiness?  · Is happiness contagious?  · Is there a difference between pleasure and happiness?  · Can unhappiness and happiness coexist?  · Does our happiness depend on our luck?  Understanding how civilization's best minds have answered those questions, Lenoir suggests, not only makes for a fascinating reading experience, but also provides a way for us to see us how happiness, that most elusive of feelings, is attainable in our own lives.||1 online resource||152.42|ebook - ebook|04/07/2015|2015-04-07|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781612194417?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ums5BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Charles Montgomery.|Happy City|Montgomery, Charles|Montgomery, Charles|Charles Montgomery|Nonfiction., Architecture and society, Architecture Human factors, Public spaces Planning, City planning Social aspects, Happiness, Environmental psychology, City planning Psychological aspects, Urban beautification Psychological aspects, Politics., Electronic books., Electronic book|Political Science|Charles Montgomery's Happy City will revolutionize the way we think about urban life.After decades of unchecked sprawl, more people than ever are moving back to the city. Dense urban living has been prescribed as a panacea for the environmental and resource crises of our time. But is it better or worse for our happiness? Are subways, sidewalks and condo towers an improvement on the car-dependence of sprawl?The award-winning journalist Charles Montgomery finds answers to such questions at the intersection between urban design and the emerging science of happiness, during an exhilarating journey through some of the world's most dynamic cities. He meets the visionary mayor who introduced a sexy bus to ease status anxiety in Bogotá; the architect who brought the lessons of medieval Tuscan hill towns to modern-day New York City; the activist who turned Paris's urban freeways into beaches; and an army of American suburbanites who have hacked the design of their own streets and neighborhoods.Rich with new insights from psychology, neuroscience and Montgomery's own urban experiments, Happy City reveals how our cities can shape our thoughts as well as our behavior. The message is as surprising as it is hopeful: by retrofitting cities and our own lives for happiness, we can tackle the urgent challenges of our age. The happy city can save the world--and all of us can help build it.||1 online resource||307.1216|ebook - ebook|11/12/2013|2013-11-12|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780385669139?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hXoBAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Avi Loeb.|Interstellar|Loeb, Avi|Loeb, Avi.|Avi Loeb|Nonfiction., Physics., Science., Electronic books.|Science|From the New York Times bestselling author of Extraterrestrial comes a mind-expanding new book explaining why becoming an interstellar species is imperative for humanity's survival and detailing a game plan for how we can settle among the stars.    In the New York Times bestseller Extraterrestrial, Avi Loeb, the longest serving Chair of Harvard's Astronomy Department, presented a theory that shook the scientific community: our solar system, Loeb claimed, had likely been visited by a piece of advanced alien technology from a distant star. This provocative and persuasive argument opened millions of minds internationally to the vast possibilities of our universe and the existence of intelligent life beyond Earth. But a crucial question remained: now that we are aware of the existence of extraterrestrial life, what do we do next? How do we prepare ourselves for interaction with interstellar extraterrestrial civilization? How can our species become interstellar?  Now Loeb tackles these questions in a revelatory, powerful call to arms that reimagines the idea of contact with extraterrestrial civilizations. Dismantling our science-fiction fueled visions of a human and alien life encounter, Interstellar provides a realistic and practical blueprint for how such an interaction might actually occur, resetting our cultural understanding and expectation of what it means to identify an extraterrestrial object. From awe-inspiring searches for extraterrestrial technology, to the heated debate of the existence of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, Loeb provides a thrilling, front-row view of the monumental progress in science and technology currently preparing us for contact. He also lays out the profound implications of becoming-or not becoming-interstellar; in an urgent, eloquent appeal for more proactive engagement with the world beyond ours, he powerfully contends why we must seek out other life forms, and in the process, choose who and what we are within the universe.  Combining cutting edge science, physics, and philosophy, Interstellar revolutionizes the approach to our search for extraterrestrial life and our preparation for its discovery. In this eye-opening, necessary look at our future, Avi Loeb artfully and expertly raises some of the most important questions facing us as humans, and proves, once again, that scientific curiosity is the key to our survival.||1 online resource||576.839|ebook - ebook|08/29/2023|2023-08-29|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780063250901?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZWOeEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Ehrman|Jesus Christ Historicity., Jesus Christ Biography Sources., Nonfiction., Religion & Spirituality., Electronic books.|Religion|The bestselling author of Misquoting Jesus, one of the most renowned and controversial Bible scholars in the world today examines oral tradition and its role in shaping the stories about Jesus we encounter in the New Testament-and ultimately in our understanding of Christianity.Throughout much of human history, our most important stories were passed down orally-including the stories about Jesus before they became written down in the Gospels. In this fascinating and deeply researched work, leading Bible scholar Bart D. Erhman investigates the role oral history has played in the New Testament-how the telling of these stories not only spread Jesus' message but helped shape it.A master explainer of Christian history, texts, and traditions, Ehrman draws on a range of disciplines, including psychology and anthropology, to examine the role of memory in the creation of the Gospels. Explaining how oral tradition evolves based on the latest scientific research, he demonstrates how the act of telling and retelling impacts the story, the storyteller, and the listener-crucial insights that challenge our typical historical understanding of the silent period between when Jesus lived and died and when his stories began to be written down.As he did in his previous books on religious scholarship, debates on New Testament authorship, and the existence of Jesus of Nazareth, Ehrman combines his deep knowledge and meticulous scholarship in a compelling and eye-opening narrative that will change the way we read and think about these sacred texts.||1 online resource||232.908|ebook - ebook|03/01/2016|2016-03-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780062285232?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oQfVCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

As a child, she frequently tried to convince her Nigerian-Jamaican mother to pull out the fine china for everyday meals or when hosting friends. Her mother always said she was waiting for a special occasion, which sadly never came before she passed away when Ajiri was only twelve. Ajiri promised herself she would never hesitate to use her treasured pieces. When she moved to Paris, France, as an adult, she learned how central that idea is to French life, and she also began to absorb other essential lessons from her new friends: treat yourself to fresh flowers just because, take time to source the best baguette, and perhaps most importantly, enjoy être—just being. In this beautifully photographed volume of everything French, Ajiri shares what she’s learned about living in Paris—from hosting the perfect apéro (happy hour) to lingering around town like a flâneur (loafer) to thrifting for antiques at the market.

Keep Pain in the Past explains a process that allows you to do most, if not all, of the recovery on your own.Train yourself in psychological self-healing: While most people know what they can do on their own to treat physical ills-like using ice on a muscle sprain-they don't realize that they can apply certain psychological principles to treat anxiety, depression and many other conditions. Keep Pain in the Past will teach you the critical 21st century skill of treating psychological wounds on your own.Treat yourself and heal old wounds: As much as people may suspect that some trauma from their past is affecting them negatively, they struggle to do anything about it.

Helen Zia.|Last Boat Out of Shanghai|Zia, Helen|Zia, Helen.|Helen Zia|Nonfiction., Emigration and immigration, Chinese Foreign countries, Refugees, Political refugees, Biography & Autobiography., History., Sociology., China, China Shanghai, Electronic books.|History|The dramatic real life stories of four young people caught up in the mass exodus of Shanghai in the wake of China's 1949 Communist revolution-a heartrending precursor to the struggles faced by emigrants today. A true page-turner. . . [Helen] Zia has proven once again that history is something that happens to real people.-New York Times bestselling author Lisa See Shanghai has historically been China's jewel, its richest, most modern and westernized city. The bustling metropolis was home to sophisticated intellectuals, entrepreneurs, and a thriving middle class when Mao's proletarian revolution emerged victorious from the long civil war. Terrified of the horrors the Communists would wreak upon their lives, citizens of Shanghai who could afford to fled in every direction. Seventy years later, members of the last generation to fully recall this massive exodus have revealed their stories to Chinese American journalist Helen Zia, who interviewed hundreds of exiles about their journey through one of the most tumultuous events of the twentieth century. From these moving accounts, Zia weaves together the stories of four young Shanghai residents who wrestled with the decision to abandon everything for an uncertain life as refugees in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the United States. Benny, who as a teenager became the unwilling heir to his father's dark wartime legacy, must decide either to escape to Hong Kong or navigate the intricacies of a newly Communist China. The resolute Annuo, forced to flee her home with her father, a defeated Nationalist official, becomes an unwelcome exile in Taiwan. The financially strapped Ho fights deportation from the U.S. in order to continue his studies while his family struggles at home. And Bing, given away by her poor parents, faces the prospect of a new life among strangers in America. The lives of these men and women are marvelously portrayed, revealing the dignity and triumph of personal survival. Herself the daughter of immigrants from China, Zia is uniquely equipped to explain how crises like the Shanghai transition affect children and their families, students and their futures, and, ultimately, the way we see ourselves and those around us. Last Boat Out of Shanghai brings a poignant personal angle to the experiences of refugees then and, by extension, today. Zia's portraits are compassionate and heartbreaking, and they are, ultimately, the universal story of many families who leave their homeland as refugees and find less-than-welcoming circumstances on the other side.-Amy Tan, author of The Joy Luck Club||1 online resource||951.042|ebook - ebook|01/22/2019|2019-01-22|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780525618867?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=acBWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Donald Sturrock.|Love from Boy|Sturrock, Donald|Sturrock, Donald.|Donald Sturrock|Nonfiction., Authors, English, English letters, Novelists, English, Biography & Autobiography., Literary Criticism., Electronic books.|Literary Collections|From the author of The BFG, Matilda, James and the Giant Peach, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and many more beloved classics-a whimsical, witty, and revealing collection of the legendary children's author and writer Roald Dahl's letters written to his mother, from early childhood through Dahl's travels to Africa, his career in the Royal Air Force, his work in post-war Washington, D.C., and Hollywood, and the books that made him a literary star.  Roald Dahl penned his first letter to his mother, Sofie Magdalene, when he was just nine years old. The origins of a brilliantly funny, subversive, creative mind were evident in boarding school, and as he entered adulthood, his penchant for storytelling emerged in his missives home from Africa, where he was stationed by Shell Oil, and then the desert camps of the Royal Air Force. His skills were sharpened after a plane crash in Egypt landed him in Washington, D.C., where his cheery letters home were cover for his work in the British Secret Service, along with gossipy updates on his spontaneous rise in Hollywood and his budding New York literary career. His mother was, in many ways, Dahl's first reader, and without her correspondence he might never have become a writer. Sofie Magdalene kept every letter her son wrote to her (sadly, her own side of the correspondence did not survive). It was she who encouraged him to tell stories and nourished his desire to fabricate, exaggerate, and entertain. In these letters, Dahl began practicing his craft, developing the dark sense of humor and fantastical imagination that would later produce his timeless tales. The author of James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, and The BFG, Dahl is known by millions the world over today. But, writing candidly to the person who knew him best, Dahl was as singular a character as any he created on paper. Assembled by Dahl's authorized biographer Donald Sturrock, Love from Boy is a remarkable collection of never-before-published writing that spans four decades and chronicles the remarkable, unpredictable life of its author. While Dahl's books remain bestselling favorites for all ages, Love from Boy provides an unprecedented glimpse of the author through his own eyes-a life punctuated by tragedy, creative stagnation, unexpected fame, and fantastic adventure.From the Hardcover edition.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|09/06/2016|2016-09-06|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780698151208?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G4G0CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Using his unique ability to present deep spiritual and theological ideas in the language of everyday life, Dr. Hahn examines the biblical and historical roots of the priesthood to explain the centrality of the priest in the life of the Church. He brings reinvigorated attention to the many roles of the priest--provider, mediator, protector, teacher, judge, and more--all of which are united in the priest's place as spiritual father to God's people, and ultimately he shows that it is through the priest, empowered by God, that the continuing presence of Jesus Christ makes itself known to our world.      Lively, insightful, and engaging, Many Are Called will serve as an inspiration to students and seminarians considering a vocation, to clergy renewing their call, to Catholic readers looking to deepen their faith, and to seekers curious about one of Catholicism's defining but least understood elements. With a foreword by the Most Reverend Timothy M. Dolan, the Archbishop of New York, this is a truly special book, one that speaks to the restless heart of humanity and reveals that our pleas for a spiritual father have already been answered.||1 online resource||253.2|ebook - ebook|06/01/2010|2010-06-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780307590787?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bnZ3aoblUIoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

By learning the natural running technique, runners can enjoy both worldsâ€comfortable feet, knees, and legs and an efficient running form that reduces impact and injuries.Natural Running teaches runners to think about injuries as symptoms of poor running form. Abshire specifies the overuse injuries that are most commonly associated with particular body alignment problems, foot types, and form flaws. Runners will learn how to analyze and identify their own characteristics so they can start down the path to natural running.Abshire explains the natural running technique, describing the posture, arm carriage, cadence, and land-lever-lift foot positioning that mimic the barefoot running style. Using Abshire's 8-week transition plan and a tool kit of strength and form drills, runners will move from heel striking to a midfoot or forefoot strike. Natural Running is the newest way to run and also the oldest. By discovering how they were meant to run, runners will become more efficient, stronger, and healthier runners.||1 online resource||796.420|ebook - ebook|01/11/2024|2010-12-01|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781937716066?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fPU5CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

How do the rich keep getting richer, while dodging the long arm of the law? From playboy billionaires avoiding taxes on private islands to Russian oligarchs sailing away from sanctions on their superyachts, the ultra-rich seem to live in a different world from the rest of us. That world is called offshore. Hidden from view, the world's ultra-rich can use offshore finance to escape tax obligations, labor and environmental safety regulations, campaign finance rules, and other laws that get in their way.   In Offshore: Stealth Wealth and the New Colonialism, sociologist Brooke Harrington reveals how this system works, as well as how it degrades democracy, the economy, and the public goods on which we all depend. Harrington spent eight years infiltrating this secretive world by training as a wealth manager, traveling from glossy European and North American capitals to developing countries in South America and Africa, to islands in the Indian Ocean, Caribbean, and South Pacific regions. Through interviews with dozens of wealth managers in nineteen countries, Harrington uncovered how this global network of offshore financial centers arose from the remnants of colonialism and has created a new, hidden imperial class   This engrossing deep dive reveals what offshore finance costs all of us, and how it has colonized the world—not on behalf of any one country, but to benefit a largely invisible empire of a few thousand billionaires, who help themselves to the best society has to offer while sticking us with the bill. As politicians struggle to address the deepening economic and political inequality destabilizing the world, Harrington's exposé of the offshore system is a vital resource for understanding the most pressing crises of our time.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|09/17/2024|2024-09-17|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781324064954?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6cPuEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Benjamin C Waterhouse.|One Day I'll Work for Myself: The Dream and Delusion That Conquered America|Waterhouse, Benjamin C.|Waterhouse, Benjamin C.|Benjamin C. Waterhouse|Nonfiction., Business., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|From side-hustlers to start-ups, freelancers to small business owners, Americans have a special affinity for people who make it on their own. But the dream has a dark side.    One day I'll work for myself. Perhaps you've heard some version of that phrase from friends, colleagues, family members—perhaps you've said it yourself. If so, you're not alone. The spirit of entrepreneurship runs deep in American culture and history, in the films we watch and the books we read, in our political rhetoric, and in the music piping through our speakers.   What makes the dream of self-employment so alluring, so pervasive in today's world? Benjamin C. Waterhouse offers a provocative argument: the modern cult of the hustle is a direct consequence of economic failures—bad jobs, stagnant wages, and inequality—since the 1970s. With original research, Waterhouse traces a new narrative history of business in America, populated with vivid characters—from the activists, academics, and work-from-home gurus who hailed business ownership as our economic salvation to the upstarts who took the plunge. We meet, among others, a consultant who quits his job and launches a wildly popular beer company, a department store saleswoman who founds a plus-size bra business on the Internet, and an Indian immigrant in Texas who flees the corporate world to open a motel. Some flourish; some squeak by. Some fail.   As Waterhouse shows, the go-it-alone movement that began in the 1970s laid the political and cultural groundwork for today's gig economy and its ethos: everyone should be their own boss. While some people find success in that world, countless others are left bouncing from gig to gig—exploited, underpaid, or conned by get-rich-quick scams. And our politics doesn't know how to respond.   Accessible, fast-paced, and eye-opening, One Day I'll Work for Myself offers a fresh, insightful cultural history of the U.S. economy from the perspective of the people within it, asking urgent questions about why we're clinging to old strategies for progress—and at what cost.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|01/16/2024|2024-01-16|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780393868227?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0QjHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

How can you find joy in the midst of deadlines, debt, drama, and even the death of loved ones? What does the Christ-life really look like when your days are gritty, long, and sometimes even dark? How is God even here?  It is in the dark that God is passing by . . . our lives shake not because God has abandoned but the exact opposite. God is passing by. God is in the tremors. Dark is the holiest ground, the glory passing by. In the blackest, God is closest, at work, forging His perfect and right will.

In One Thousand Gifts, Ann Voskamp invites you to discover a way of seeing that opens your eyes to ordinary amazing grace, a way of living that is fully alive, and a way of becoming present to God that brings deep and lasting joy. It's only in the expression of gratitude for the life we already have, we discover the life we've always wanted . . . a life we can take, give thanks for, and break for others. Come to feel and know the impossible right down in your bones: you are wildly loved by God.  As Ann invites you into her own beautiful, heart-aching moments of amazing grace, she gently teaches you how to:  Biblically lament loss and turn pain into poetry  Intentionally embrace a lifestyle of radical gratitude  Slow down and catch God in the moment  Not a book merely to read, One Thousand Gifts is an invitation to engage with truths that will serve up the depths of God's joy and transform your life forever.

We now can manufacture, transport, and organize things more cheaply and faster than ever. Optimized models underlie everything from airline schedules to dating site matches. We strive for efficiency in our daily lives, obsessed with productivity and optimal performance. How did a mathematical concept take on such outsize cultural shape? And what is lost when efficiency is gained?   Optimal Illusions  traces the fascinating history of optimization from its roots in America’s founding principles to its modern manifestations, found in colorful stories of oil tycoons, wildlife ecologists, Silicon Valley technologists, lifestyle gurus, sugar beet farmers, and poker players. Optimization is now deeply embedded in the technologies and assumptions that have come to comprise not only our material reality but what we make of it. Coco Krumme’s work in mathematical modeling has made her acutely aware of optimization’s overreach. Streamlined systems are less resilient and more at risk of failure. They limit our options and narrow our perspectives. The malaise of living in an optimized society can feel profoundly inhumane.  Optimal Illusions  exposes the sizable bargains we have made in the name of optimization and asks us to consider what comes next.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|09/12/2023|2023-09-12|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593331132?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lcyrEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

They experience a lack of motivation and a growing indifference to important things, with some even struggling to care about anything at all. This listlessness can spill over into our spiritual lives, making it difficult to pray, read the Bible, or engage in our communities. Have we resigned ourselves to apathy? Do we recognize it as a sin? How can we fight against it?   In Overcoming Apathy, theology professor Uche Anizor explains what apathy is and gives practical, biblical advice to break the cycle. Inspired by his conversations with young Christians as well as his own experiences with apathy, Anizor takes a fresh look at this widespread problem and its effect on spiritual maturity. First, he highlights the prevalence of apathy in our culture, using examples from TV, movies, and social media. Next, he turns to theologians, philosophers, and psychologists to further define apathy. Finally, Anizor explores causes, cures, and healthy practices to boldly overcome apathy in daily life, taking believers from spiritual lethargy to Christian zeal. This short ebook is an excellent resource for those struggling with apathy as well as parents, mentors, and friends who want to support someone in need.||1 online resource||241.3|ebook - ebook|03/02/2022|2022-03-02|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781433578830?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RHJgEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Now, for the first time, she chronicles her groundbreaking tenure as editor in chief of Gourmet.A must for any food lover . . . Reichl is a warm, intimate writer. She peels back the curtain to a glamorous time of magazine-making. You'll tear through this memoir.-Refinery29 (The Best New Books of April 2019) When Condé Nast offered Ruth Reichl the top position at America's oldest epicurean magazine, she declined. She was a writer, not a manager, and had no inclination to be anyone's boss. Yet Reichl had been reading Gourmet since she was eight; it had inspired her career. How could she say no? This is the story of a former Berkeley hippie entering the corporate world and worrying about losing her soul. It is the story of the moment restaurants became an important part of popular culture, a time when the rise of the farm-to-table movement changed, forever, the way we eat. Readers will meet legendary chefs like David Chang and Eric Ripert, idiosyncratic writers like David Foster Wallace, and a colorful group of editors and art directors who, under Reichl's leadership, transformed stately Gourmet into a cutting-edge publication. This was the golden age of print media-the last spendthrift gasp before the Internet turned the magazine world upside down. Complete with recipes, Save Me the Plums is a personal journey of a woman coming to terms with being in charge and making a mark, following a passion and holding on to her dreams-even when she ends up in a place she never expected to be.Praise for Save Me the PlumsPoignant and hilarious . . . simply delicious . . . Each serving of magazine folklore is worth savoring. In fact, Reichl's story is juicier than a Peter Luger porterhouse. Dig in.-The New York Times Book Review In this smart, touching, and dishy memoir . . . Ruth Reichl recalls her years at the helm of Gourmet magazine with clear eyes, a sense of humor, and some very appealing recipes.-Town & Country (The Must-Read Books of Spring 2019) Intensely evocative . . .

Y., 1951-|Religion|Common sense tells us that to lose weight, we must eat less and exercise more. But somehow we get stalled. We start on a weight-loss program with good intentions but cannot stay on track. Neither the countless fad diets, nor the annual spending of $50 billion on weight loss helps us feel better or lose weight.Too many of us are in a cycle of shame and guilt. We spend countless hours worrying about what we ate or if we exercised enough, blaming ourselves for actions that we can't undo. We are stuck in the past and unable to live in the present-that moment in which we do have the power to make changes in our lives.With Savor, world-renowned Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh and Harvard nutritionist Dr. Lilian Cheung show us how to end our struggles with weight once and for all.Offering practical tools, including personalized goal setting, a detailed nutrition guide, and a mindful living plan, the authors help us to uncover the roots of our habits and then guide us as we transform our actions. Savor teaches us how to easily adopt the practice of mindfulness and integrate it into eating, exercise, and all facets of our daily life, so that being conscious and present becomes a core part of our being.It is the awareness of the present moment, the realization of why we do what we do, that enables us to stop feeling bad and start changing our behavior. Savor not only helps us achieve the healthy weight and well-being we seek, but it also brings to the surface the rich abundance of life available to us in every moment.||1 online resource||294.34446|ebook - ebook|03/09/2010|2010-03-09|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780061981456?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ipVQZMVx_TEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The four spies at the center of this story were part of a ragtag unit known as the Arab Section, conceived during World War II by British spies and Jewish militia leaders in Palestine. Intended to gather intelligence and carry out sabotage and assassinations, the unit consisted of Jews who were native to the Arab world and could thus easily assume Arab identities. In 1948, with Israel's existence in the balance during the War of Independence, our spies went undercover in Beirut, where they spent the next two years operating out of a kiosk, collecting intelligence, and sending messages back to Israel via a radio whose antenna was disguised as a clothesline. While performing their dangerous work these men were often unsure to whom they were reporting, and sometimes even who they'd become. Of the dozen spies in the Arab Section at the war's outbreak, five were caught and executed. But in the end the Arab Section would emerge, improbably, as the nucleus of the Mossad, Israel's vaunted intelligence agency.Spies of No Country is about the slippery identities of these young spies, but it's also about Israel's own complicated and fascinating identity. Israel sees itself and presents itself as a Western nation, when in fact more than half the country has Middle Eastern roots and traditions, like the spies of this story. And, according to Friedman, that goes a long way toward explaining the life and politics of the country, and why it often baffles the West. For anyone interested in real-life spies and the paradoxes of the Middle East, Spies of No Country is an intimate story with global significance.||1 online resource||327.1209569|ebook - ebook|03/05/2019|2019-03-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781616209414?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P_xrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

James Wise.|Thailand: History, Politics and the Rule of Law|Wise, James|Wise, James.|James Wise|Nonfiction., Law Thailand., History., Thailand History., Thailand Politics and government., Electronic books.|History|This introductory book on Thai politics and the rule of law explains why chronically unstable Thailand struggles to mediate and adjudicate its political disputes. It focuses on the continuities between the pre-1932 and post-1932 periods. Since the shift to constitutional monarchy in 1932, the power of the monarch and military has endured, the legislature, electorate and, until recently, judiciary have been comparatively powerless, and constitutions and laws have been comparatively unimportant. Historical continuities are also evident in the persistence of hierarchical thinking and ethno-nationalism, both of which have inhibited open debates about governance. And the rule of law does not always apply, owing to different principles underlying western and traditional Siamese law and the emergence of a distinctively Thai legal culture and consciousness. Thailand's governance was re-cast ambitiously in the 1890s, 1932 and 1997. Since 1997, governing Thailand and developing Thailand's economy have become harder. So political disputes have become more acute and the absence of a national consensus on dispute settlement mechanisms more obvious. Until governance is again re-cast, Thailand's political instability and cycle of coups will continue.||1 online resource||959.3|ebook - ebook|05/13/2019|2019-04-15|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9789814868068?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n7SaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It is a dramatic story featuring the giants of Israeli history-Moshe Dayan, Golda Meir, Levi Eshkol, Yigal Allon-as well as more contemporary figures like Ariel Sharon, Yitzhak Rabin, and Shimon Peres. Gorenberg also shows how the Johnson, Nixon, and Ford administrations turned a blind eye to what was happening in the territories, and reveals their strategic reasons for doing so.  Drawing on newly opened archives and extensive interviews, Gorenberg reconstructs what the top officials knew and when they knew it, while weaving in the dramatic first-person accounts of the settlers themselves. Fast-moving and penetrating,  The Accidental Empire  casts the entire enterprise in a new and controversial light, calling into question much of what we think we know about this issue that continues to haunt the Middle East.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|03/06/2007|2007-03-06|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781466800540?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Np_j5sSpCrEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Using Chinese military genius Sun Tzu's strategies as a guide, Brown examines why some companies triumph while others crumble.  Business is a fight for survival. In business as in war, leaders match their wills in pursuit of opposing outcomes, they devise strategies, and marshal resources for victory. Success can turn on the smallest of details; a single tactical blunder can topple an empire. Ultimately, one side triumphs-and victory is all that matters.  David Brown, host of the hit podcast Business Wars, masterfully frames some of the biggest business rivalries in history using revered Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu's insights and pragmatic advice. Each rivalry he examines tells a story of combined wits, strategies, and resources. Brown chronicles the rise of companies as they vanquish rivals, formulate innovative plans, and adapt to keep up with shifting societal needs. The goal? Stay ahead of the competition and emerge victorious as an industry titan.  By compiling powerful insights uncovered over hundreds of episodes and more than a year of in-depth research, Brown has developed a formula for business intrigue that uses popular history as a hook to lure readers in. The stories in The Art of Business Wars are fascinating, but the lessons we draw from them-about determination, ingenuity, patience, grit, subtlety, and other traits that contribute to a victorious enterprise-are invaluable, whether you're a software-slinging freelancer or the CEO of a multinational manufacturer.||1 online resource||658|ebook - ebook|04/13/2021|2021-04-13|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780063019539?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v-XwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Gene Wisniewski.|The Art of Looking at Art|Wisniewski, Gene|Wisniewski, Gene.|Gene Wisniewski|Nonfiction., Art., History., Electronic books.|Art|A readable guide to the art of looking at art. There's an art to viewing art. A sizable portion of the population regards art with varying degrees of reverence, bewilderment, suspicion, contempt, and intimidation. Most people aren't sure what to do when standing before a work of art, besides gaze at it for what they hope is an acceptable amount of time, and even those who visit galleries and museums regularly aren't always as well versed as they wish they could be.  This book will help remedy that situation and answer many of the most frequently asked questions pertaining to the matter of art in general:   When was the first art made?   Who decides which art is for the ages?   What is art's purpose?   How do paintings get to be worth tens of millions of dollars?   Where do artists get their ideas?   And perhaps the most pressing question of all, have human cadavers ever been used as art materials? (Yup.)    The Art of Looking at Art addresses these and countless more of the issues surrounding this frequently misunderstood microcosm, in a highly informative, yet conversational tone. History, fascinating and altogether human backstories, and information pertaining to every conceivable aspect of visual art are interwoven in twelve concise chapters, providing all the information the average person needs to comfortably approach, analyze, and appreciate art. Readers with a background in art will learn a few new things as well.  This beautiful full-color book includes 45 full-page reproductions.||1 online resource||701.18|ebook - ebook|10/04/2020|2020-10-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781538133736?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Hm70DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In 2013, when friends Liesl Clark and Rebecca Rockefeller launched the first Facebook Buy Nothing Project group in their small town off the coast of Seattle, they never expected it to become a viral sensation. Today there are thousands of Buy Nothing groups all over the world, boasting more than a million members, and 5,000 highly active volunteers.   In their island community, Clark and Rockefeller discovered that the beaches of Puget Sound were spoiled by a daily influx of plastic items and trash washing on shore. From pens and toothbrushes to toys and straws, they wondered, where did it all come from? Of course, it comes from  us -our homes, our backyards, our cars, and workplaces. And so, a rallying cry against excess stuff was born.   Inspired by the ancient practice of gift economies, where neighbors share and pool resources,  The Buy Nothing, Get Everything Plan  introduces an environmentally conscious 7-step guide that teaches us how to buy less, give more, and live generously. At once an actionable plan and a thought-provoking exploration of our addiction to stuff, this powerful program will help you declutter your home without filling landfills, shop more thoughtfully and discerningly, and let go of the need to buy new things.

Feeling overwhelmed and stressed? Go back to the basics by writing out a simple checklist. It will change your life.    Simplicity at its best:  The checklist is one of the world's oldest-and most effective-productivity systems. If anything, author and entrepreneur Alexandra Franzen shares, it is just as valuable now as it was during the days of the Roman Empire. Writing out a simple checklist allows us to tangibly plan our day and set in stone what we want to accomplish.   Cut out unnecessary noise:  There are countless apps and organizational systems out there to help us straighten out our lives, but often they only add to the madness. Trying to keep up leaves us feeling drained and overwhelmed. Learn how to choose your highest priorities, set realistic goals, celebrate tiny wins, and feel calmer every day with the magic of checklists.   Be realistic about the time in a day:  By physically writing down our tasks on a single piece of paper, we force ourselves to limit how much we can do in a day. Too often, we cram our day with tasks and chores and leave almost no space for self-care or time with loved ones. We end up disappointed in our inability to complete our never-ending to-do list. Checklists help you plan your day in a more gentle, realistic way. You accomplish what needs to be done-and enjoy things you want to be doing, too.

From one of our most innovative and celebrated authors, the definitive take on the wildest story of the year- the David-vs.-Goliath GameStop short squeeze, a tale of fortunes won and lost overnight that may end up changing Wall Street forever.  Bestselling author Ben Mezrich offers a gripping, beat-by-beat account of how a loosely affiliate group of private investors and internet trolls on a subreddit called WallStreetBets took down one of the biggest hedge funds on Wall Street, firing the first shot in a revolution that threatens to upend the establishment. It's the story of financial titans like Gabe Plotkin of hedge fund Melvin Capital, one of the most respected and staid funds on the Street, billionaires like Elon Musk, Steve Cohen, Mark Cuban, Robinhood co-CEOs Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, and Ken Griffin of Citadel Securities. Over the course of four incredible days, each in their own way must reckon with a formidable force they barely understand, let alone saw coming: everyday men and women on WallStreetBets like nurse Kim Campbell, college student Jeremy Poe, and the enigmatic Keith RoaringKitty Gill, whose unfiltered livestream videos captivated a new generation of stock market enthusiasts. The unlikely focus of the battle: GameStop, a flailing brick-and-mortar dinosaur catering to teenagers and outsiders that had somehow held on as the world rapidly moved online. At first, WallStreetBets was a joke-a meme-filled, freewheeling place to share shoot-the-moon investment tips, laugh about big losses, and post diamond hand emojis. Until some members noticed an opportunity in GameStop-and rode a rocket ship to tens of millions of dollars in earnings overnight. In thrilling, pulse-pounding prose, THE ANTISOCIAL NETWORK offers a fascinating, never-before-seen glimpse at the outsize personalities, dizzying swings, corporate drama, and underestimated American heroes and heroines who captivated the nation during one of the most volatile weeks in financial history.

Ricardo Sunderland.|The Energy Advantage|Sunderland, Ricardo|Sunderland, Ricardo.|Ricardo Sunderland|Nonfiction., Business., Economics., New Age., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|How do you maximize your success and impact as a leader while maintaining your stamina and sanity? The answer doesn't lie in simple efficiency. It's not about making better use of your time and resources. It's about understanding how energy works and how to tap into its power.   Many people live lives of intense, and false, emotional compartmentalization. For example, they strive to be one person in the corner office (invincible warrior) and another person at the dinner table (sensitive spouse), and they struggle to keep those two lives from bleeding into and contradicting each other. But as it turns out, this takes a tremendous amount of energy and is almost always impossible. One person can't be two different people.  So how do you live an integrated life of fulfillment, purpose, and success? How do you create an alignment between head, heart, and the creative power that is in coherence with your true self? The answer is both simple and complex: You need to move from managing your time to mastering your energy.  For more than a decade and a half, Ricardo Sunderland has worked with the leaders of some of the largest and most recognizable companies in the world. He has learned firsthand that for today's leaders—at all levels in their organizations—mental and physical energy are no longer all you need for success. Today's leaders must bring emotional and spiritual energy to their roles and create a space in which both they and their team members feel safe to challenge each other, grow together, and thrive.  Given this major leadership challenge, leaders must gain the energy advantage.  You will learn:  What gives you energy.  How to identify the energy blockers that are holding you back.  That every situation presents a choice for you to unlock the transformational source of energy within you.  The path to gaining the energy advantage on seven distinct levels.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|06/04/2024|2024-06-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781400248926?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=siHiEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Tiffani Bova.|The Experience Mindset|Bova, Tiffani|Bova, Tiffani.|Tiffani Bova|Nonfiction., Business., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|From the  Wall Street Journal  bestselling author of  Growth IQ  comes a guide to enhancing customer and employee experience simultaneously for unprecedented revenue growth  In the war for customer acquisition, businesses invest millions of dollars to improve customer experience. They deliver packages faster, churn out new products, and endlessly revamp their UI, often putting greater strain on employees for diminishing returns. According to Tiffani Bova, this siloed focus on customer experience – without considering the impact on your staff – actually  hinders  growth in the long run. The most successful companies adopt an  Experience Mindset  that strengthens  both  employee experience (EX) and customer experience (CX) at the same time. Based on exclusive research from two Salesforce-sponsored studies of thousands of employees and c-suite executives,  The Experience Mindset  details exactly how your company can adopt an Experience Mindset, at scale. It’s not enough to know that happy employees equals happy customers. You must have an intentional, balanced approach to company strategy that involves all stakeholders – IT, Marketing, Sales, Operations, and HR – with KPIs and ownership over outcomes. In this ground-breaking book, filled with case studies of leading companies and never-before-seen research, you’ll learn:  How people, processes, technology, and culture contribute to the “virtuous cycle” of EX and CX.  Why the best companies have programs that minimize the customer’s effort as well as the employee’s effort (and how companies like Southwest and Best Buy get this right)  How to effectively roll out technology solutions that boost both EX and CX (hard truth: only 20% of customer-facing employees believe technology makes their job easier. Employees want a seamless technology experience, just like your customers.)  What metrics you can use to measure EX, CX, and ultimately, the effect of the two together. You can’t improve what you can’t measure.   Employees are the heart of your business. If you want to remain competitive in today’s marketplace, investing in people is no longer a nice-to-have, but rather a must have.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|06/06/2023|2023-06-06|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780593542705?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gk6GEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Robert McLean.||McLean, Robert|McLean, Robert.||Nonfiction., Business., Economics., Electronic books.||The world is changing faster and faster, with increasing uncertainty and threat of disruption in every business and nonprofit segment. Conventional approaches to strategy development and problem solving no longer work-there is no stable industry or market equilibrium structure that we will return to when change abates. Most company planning processes are fantasy; market conditions are changing too quickly for arm-chair strategizing to be useful. As a consequence, many management teams are stuck in a wait-and-see posture in response to extreme uncertainty in the post-Covid environment, while others are making panicky bets, including 'leap before you look' acquisitions.  In this sequel to their Amazon-bestseller,  Bulletproof Problem Solving , Conn and McLean introduce a novel approach to strategic problem solving. Based on a decade of research and 30 new case studies,  The Imperfectionists  posits a dynamic approach to developing organizational direction under uncertainty based on harnessing six reinforcing strategic mindsets, which they call curiosity, dragonfly eye, occurrent behaviour, collective wisdom, imperfectionism, and show and tell.  Imperfectionists are curious, they look at problems from several perspectives, and gather new data and approaches, including from outside their current industry. They deliberately step into risk, proceeding through trial and error, utilizing nimble low consequence and reversible moves to deepen their understanding of the unfolding game being played, and to build capabilities. They accept ambiguity and some apparent failures in exchange for improved learning and market position. Imperfectionists succeed with dynamic, real time strategic problem solving, confidently moving forward while others wait for certainty, or make impetuous and foolish bets.  These strategic mindsets for solving tough problems in uncertain times help you fight decision biases and give you the data to develop informed strategies to win. In the fast changing world we all find ourselves in, being an imperfectionist is a critical advantage for you and your organization.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|04/12/2023||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781119835684?s=MD|

In this revelatory, unnerving, and ultimately hopeful book, Bremmer details how domestic and international conflicts leave us unprepared for a trio of looming crises-global health emergencies, transformative climate change, and the AI revolution. Today, Americans cannot reach consensus on any significant political issue, and US and Chinese leaders behave as if they're locked in a new Cold War. We are squandering opportunities to meet the challenges that will soon confront us all.   In coming years, humanity will face viruses deadlier and more infectious than Covid. Intensifying climate change will put tens of millions of refugees in flight and require us to reimagine how we live our daily lives. Most dangerous of all, new technologies will reshape the geopolitical order, disrupting our livelihoods and destabilizing our societies faster than we can grasp and address their implications.    The good news? Some farsighted political leaders, business decision-makers, and individual citizens are already collaborating to tackle all these crises. The question that should keep us awake is whether they will work well and quickly enough to limit the fallout-and, most importantly, whether we can use these crises to innovate our way toward a better world.   Drawing on strategies both time-honored and cutting-edge, from the Marshall Plan to the Green New Deal,  T  he   P  ower   of   C  risis    provides a roadmap for surviving-even thriving in-the 21st century. Bremmer shows governments, corporations, and every concerned citizen how we can use these coming crises to create the worldwide prosperity and opportunity that 20th-century globalism promised but failed to deliver.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|05/17/2022|2022-05-17|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781982167523?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z6Y1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Alicia Britt Chole.|The Sacred Slow|Chole, Alicia|Chole, Alicia Britt.|Alicia Britt Chole|Nonfiction., Devotional calendars., Religion & Spirituality., Electronic books.|Religion|If yesterday's word was simple, tomorrow's word will be slow. Our culture is shifting from fast food to health food both physically and spiritually. Self-care, soul-care, life coaches, and spiritual retreats all show our dissatisfaction in quick fixes and fast faith. The Sacred Slow is an invitation to unhurried honesty before God. Formatted as 52 experiences, The Sacred Slow reminds readers on every page that God never wanted to use them: He always wanted to love them. Experienced devotionally or in small groups, each chapter features a short but unexpected reading and two options for application: a thought focus or a heart exercise. The content is the overflow of Dr. Alicia Britt Chole's thirty+ years as a spiritual mentor to leaders and learners. The tone is personal, practical, and penetrating. The fruit is sustainable (as opposed to event-based) intimacy with God.||1 online resource||242.2|ebook - ebook|08/22/2023|2017-09-26|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780718094966?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yW17DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

A fascinating (Thomas L. Friedman, New York Times) look at how digital technology is transforming our work and our lives. In recent years, Google's autonomous cars have logged thousands of miles on American highways and IBM's Watson trounced the best human Jeopardy! players. Digital technologies-with hardware, software, and networks at their core-will in the near future diagnose diseases more accurately than doctors can, apply enormous data sets to transform retailing, and accomplish many tasks once considered uniquely human. In The Second Machine Age MIT's Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee-two thinkers at the forefront of their field-reveal the forces driving the reinvention of our lives and our economy. As the full impact of digital technologies is felt, we will realize immense bounty in the form of dazzling personal technology, advanced infrastructure, and near-boundless access to the cultural items that enrich our lives. Amid this bounty will also be wrenching change. Professions of all kinds-from lawyers to truck drivers-will be forever upended. Companies will be forced to transform or die. Recent economic indicators reflect this shift: fewer people are working, and wages are falling even as productivity and profits soar. Drawing on years of research and up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson and McAfee identify the best strategies for survival and offer a new path to prosperity. These include revamping education so that it prepares people for the next economy instead of the last one, designing new collaborations that pair brute processing power with human ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a radically transformed landscape. A fundamentally optimistic book, The Second Machine Age alters how we think about issues of technological, societal, and economic progress.||1 online resource||303.483|ebook - ebook|07/29/2015|2014-01-20|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780393241259?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PMBUAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Widely hailed for its sweeping, sobering account of the American past (New York Times Book Review), Jill Lepore's one-volume history of America places truth itself-a devotion to facts, proof, and evidence-at the center of the nation's history. The American experiment rests on three ideas-these truths, Jefferson called them-political equality, natural rights, and the sovereignty of the people. But has the nation, and democracy itself, delivered on that promise?   These Truths tells this uniquely American story, beginning in 1492, asking whether the course of events over more than five centuries has proven the nation's truths, or belied them. To answer that question, Lepore wrestles with the state of American politics, the legacy of slavery, the persistence of inequality, and the nature of technological change. A nation born in contradiction... will fight, forever, over the meaning of its history, Lepore writes, but engaging in that struggle by studying the past is part of the work of citizenship. With These Truths, Lepore has produced a book that will shape our view of American history for decades to come.||1 online resource||973|ebook - ebook|09/18/2018|2018-09-18|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780393635256?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v2ZSDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Drawing on the latest research and on musical examples ranging from Mozart to Duke Ellington to Van Halen, he reveals:&#8226; How composers produce some of the most pleasurable effects of listening to music by exploiting the way our brains make sense of the world&#8226; Why we are so emotionally attached to the music we listened to as teenagers, whether it was Fleetwood Mac, U2, or Dr. Dre&#8226; That practice, rather than talent, is the driving force behind musical expertise&#8226; How those insidious little jingles (called earworms) get stuck in our headA Los Angeles Times Book Award finalist, This Is Your Brain on Music will attract readers of Oliver Sacks and David Byrne, as it is an unprecedented, eye-opening investigation into an obsession at the heart of human nature.||1 online resource||781.11|ebook - ebook|08/03/2006|2006-08-03|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781101218914?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_B3CEBJhhBQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Struggling on without thinking through how to make it work can lead to exhaustion, unhappiness, burn-out or depression.   No Time To Breathe  presents  practical ideas  that come out of Dr Bill Mitchell's clinical experience in getting people back to a zone of better energy, balance, fulfilment and more balanced ways of thinking about themselves.  Through  case studies  of the everyday lives of people in many walks of professional life, we see how many of us can accidentally set off down a pathway that takes us away from our previously healthy robust selves - often without recognising it. When we can no longer stabilise our emotions and protect our energy we become overwhelmed, and rather than confident become self-doubting, guilty and anxious.    This book describes  three key building blocks of a balancing system  to keep us within the energised healthy zone, in spite of the pressures we are under at work and at home. These are:  self-awareness , an understanding of the  physiology of energy , and a willingness to lead a more  decisions-based life  for better balance and effective working. Together, these form an overarching empowered mindset, freeing us from the mental habits that lead us to de-prioritise time for ourselves. And leading to far happier outcomes than feeling trapped and helpless, or walking away from career paths into which we have invested years of our lives.||1 online resource||155.9042|ebook - ebook|09/17/2020|2020-09-17|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781472973009?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dtvnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

An Amazon Best Book of January.

The prescient, page-turning account of a journey in Silicon Valley: a defining memoir of our digital age   In her mid-twenties, at the height of tech industry idealism, Anna Wiener-stuck, broke, and looking for meaning in her work, like any good millennial-left a job in book publishing for the promise of the new digital economy. She moved from New York to San Francisco, where she landed at a big-data startup in the heart of the Silicon Valley bubble: a world of surreal extravagance, dubious success, and fresh-faced entrepreneurs hell-bent on domination, glory, and, of course,  progress .  Anna arrived amidst a massive cultural shift, as the tech industry rapidly transformed into a locus of wealth and power rivaling Wall Street. But amid the company ski vacations and in-office speakeasies, boyish camaraderie and ride-or-die corporate fealty, a new Silicon Valley began to emerge: one in far over its head, one that enriched itself at the expense of the idyllic future it claimed to be building.   Part coming-of-age-story, part portrait of an already-bygone era, Anna Wiener's memoir is a rare first-person glimpse into high-flying, reckless startup culture at a time of unchecked ambition, unregulated surveillance, wild fortune, and accelerating political power. With wit, candor, and heart, Anna deftly charts the tech industry's shift from self-appointed world savior to democracy-endangering liability, alongside a personal narrative of aspiration, ambivalence, and disillusionment.  Unsparing and incisive,  Uncanny Valley  is a cautionary tale, and a revelatory interrogation of a world reckoning with consequences its unwitting designers are only beginning to understand.||1 online resource||338.476|ebook - ebook|01/14/2020|2020-01-14|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780374719760?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5fqTDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Mark Carney.|Values|Carney, Mark|Carney, Mark.|Mark Carney|Nonfiction., Business., Economics., Finance., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|A bold and urgent argument by economist and former bank governor Mark Carney on the radical, foundational change that is required if we are to build an economy and society based not on market values but on human values.   Our world is full of fault lines-growing inequality in income and opportunity; systemic racism; health and economic crises from a global pandemic; mistrust of experts; the existential threat of climate change; deep threats to employment in a digital economy with robotics on the rise. These fundamental problems and others like them, argues Mark Carney, stem from a common crisis in values. Drawing on the turmoil of the past decade, Mark Carney shows how market economies have evolved into market societies where price determines the value of everything.   When we think about what we, as individuals, value most highly, we might list fairness, health, the protection of our rights, economic security from poverty, the preservation of natural diversity, resources, and beauty. The tragedy is, these things that we hold dearest are too often the casualties of our twenty-first century world, where they ought to be our bedrock.  In this profoundly important new book, Mark Carney offers a vision of a more humane society and a practical manifesto for getting there. How we reform our infrastructure to make things better and fairer is at the heart of every chapter, with outlines of wholly new ideas that can restructure society and enshrine our human values at the core of all that we build for our children and grandchildren.||1 online resource||303.372|ebook - ebook|03/16/2021|2021-03-16|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780771051562?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_vL4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

War  is an intimate and sweeping account of one of the most tumultuous periods in presidential politics and American history.   We see President Joe Biden and his top advisers in tense conversations with Russian president Vladimir Putin, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. We also see Donald Trump, conducting a shadow presidency and seeking to regain political power.   With unrivaled, inside-the-room reporting, Woodward shows President Biden's approach to managing the war in Ukraine, the most significant land war in Europe since World War II, and his tortured path to contain the bloody Middle East conflict between Israel and the terrorist group Hamas.   Woodward reveals the extraordinary complexity and consequence of wartime back-channel diplomacy and decision-making to deter the use of nuclear weapons and a rapid slide into World War III.   The raw cage-fight of politics accelerates as Americans prepare to vote in 2024, starting between President Biden and Trump, and ending with the unexpected elevation of Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for president.    War  provides an unvarnished examination of the vice president as she tries to embrace the Biden legacy and policies while beginning to chart a path of her own as a presidential candidate.    Woodward's reporting once again sets the standard for journalism at its most authoritative and illuminating.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|10/15/2024|2024-10-15|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781668052297?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DwsYEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Even more amazing, this incredible rate of return was produced with very low rates of risk. Long considered one of the most powerful and profitable of Buffett's investment operations, but the least understood, these special types of investments have been the edge that made Warren Buffett so phenomenally successful. Warren Buffett and the Art of Stock Arbitrage is the first book to examine Buffett's special brand of arbitrage investing. Buffettologists Mary Buffett and David Clark explore the previously secret domain of Warren Buffett's stock arbitrage investments. They explain how Buffett finds deals, evaluates them, picks the winners from the losers, and when he is willing to use leverage to help boost his performance in these investments to make amazing profits. Basic mathematical equations are included to help readers determine the projected rate of return, evaluate risk, and determine the probability of the deal being a success. Buffett and Clark provide detailed explanations and examples of Warren Buffett's methods for arbitrage, and for investing in tender offers, liquidations, spin-offs, and reorganizations. They take readers step by step from the initial public announcement to tendering shares, explaining how Buffett evaluates risk and maximizes his profit at every step. Warren Buffett and the Art of Stock Arbitrage is a valuable companion to the other books in Buffett and Clark's successful series--Buffettology, The Buffettology Workbook, The New Buffettology, The Tao of Warren Buffett, Warren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements, and Warren Buffett's Management Secrets.||1 online resource||332.645|ebook - ebook|11/09/2010|2010-11-09|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781451606454?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2ZAptMWcCdwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Rachel Rodgers.|We Should All Be Millionaires|Rodgers, Rachel|Rodgers, Rachel.|Rachel Rodgers|Nonfiction., Business., Economics., Women's Studies., Electronic books.|Business & Economics|While ninety percent of the world's millionaires are men, only ten percent are women, making it difficult for women to wield the economic power that will create lasting equality. Rachel Rodgers, founder of Hello Seven, a company that coaches women in scaling their businesses and their lives to seven figures, says it's time for a change.   Women deserve the economic power and equality that comes with wealth, and we all have it in us to be millionaires. We Should All Be Millionaires details a realistic, achievable, step-by-step path to become a millionaire within the next three years.  Whatever is currently stopping you from having seven figures in the bank-whether it is doubt, feeling overwhelmed, imposter syndrome, trying too many things, or simply not knowing where to begin-this book shows you how to clear every obstacle in your way.  We Should All Be Millionaires will forever change the way you think about money and your ability to earn it.  In this book, Rachel Rodgers-mother of four, attorney, business owner, and self-made Black millionaire- shares the lessons she's learned both in her own journey to wealth and in coaching hundreds of women through their own journeys to seven figures.  Inside, you'll learn:  Why earning more money is not selfish or greedy but in fact, a revolutionary act that brings the economy into balance and creates a better world for all.  Why most of the financial advice you've heard in the past (like skip your daily latte to save money) is absolute nonsense.  An eye-opening history lesson on how women and people of color have been shut out of the ability to build wealth for centuries-and how we can fix this.  How to stop making broke-ass decisions that leave you feeling emotionally and financially depleted, and start making million dollar decisions instead.  Why aiming to earn $100K per year is not enough, and why you need to be setting your goals much higher.  The crucial ingredients you need if you are serious about becoming a millionaire: including your million-dollar vision, million-dollar squad, and more.  Strategies to bring more money in the door and fatten your bank account immediately. (Including Rodgers' $10K in 10 Days Challenge which hundreds of women have completed-with incredible results.)  It's time to construct an entirely new attitude about money, claim your power, and build the financial security that you need and deserve.||1 online resource||332.0240108|ebook - ebook|05/04/2021|2021-05-04|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781400221639?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EeDtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Thus must sound money be the first bastion of a society's defence.In 1923, with its currency effectively worthless (the exchange rate in December of that year was one dollar to 4,200,000,000,000 marks), the Weimar Republic was all but reduced to a barter economy. Expensive cigars, artworks and jewels were routinely exchanged for staples such as bread; a cinema ticket could be bought for a lump of coal, and a bottle of paraffin for a silk shirt. In desperation, the Bavarian Prime Minister submitted a Bill to the Reichsrat proposing that gluttony be made a penal offence, his exact definition of a glutton being 'one who habitually devotes himself to the pleasures of the table to such a degree that he might arouse discontent in view of the distressful condition of the population'.Since its first publication in 1975, When Money Dies has become the classic history of these bizarre and frightening times. Weaving elegant analysis with a wealth of eyewitness accounts by ordinary people struggling to survive, it deals above all with the human side of inflation: why governments resort to it, the dismal, corruptive pestilence it visits on their citizens, the agonies of recovery, and the dark, long-term legacy. And at a time of acute economic strain, it provides an urgent warning against the addictive dangers of printing money -- shorthand for deficit financing -- as a soft option for governments faced with growing unrest and unemployment.||1 online resource||330.943085|ebook - ebook|09/01/2010||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781906964535?s=MD|

Meg Kissinger.|While You Were Out|Kissinger, Meg|Kissinger, Meg.|Meg Kissinger|Nonfiction., Biography & Autobiography., Family & Relationships., Electronic books.|Biography & Autobiography|From award-winning journalist Meg Kissinger, a searing memoir of a family besieged by mental illness, as well as an incisive exploration of the systems that failed them and a testament to the love that sustained them.  Growing up in the 1960s in the suburbs of Chicago, Meg Kissinger's family seemed to live a charmed life. With eight kids and two loving parents, the Kissingers radiated a warm, boisterous energy. Whether they were spending summer days on the shores of Lake Michigan, barreling down the ski slopes, or navigating the trials of their Catholic school, the Kissingers always knew how to live large and play hard. But behind closed doors, a harsher reality was unfolding—a heavily medicated mother hospitalized for anxiety and depression, a manic father prone to violence, and children in the throes of bipolar disorder and depression, two of whom would take their own lives. Through it all, the Kissingers faced the world with their signature dark humor and the unspoken family rule: never talk about it.  While You Were Out  begins as the personal story of one family's struggles then opens outward, as Kissinger details how childhood tragedy catalyzed a journalism career focused on exposing our country's flawed mental health care. Combining the intimacy of memoir with the rigor of investigative reporting, the book explores the consequences of shame, the havoc of botched public policy, and the hope offered by new treatment strategies.  Powerful, candid and filled with surprising humor, this is the story of one family's love and resilience in face of great loss.||1 online resource||Missing Value|ebook - ebook|09/05/2023|2023-09-05|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781250877024?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WmCBEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

James Achilles Kirkpatrick was the British Resident at the court of Hyderabad when he met Khair un-Nissa -- 'Most Excellent among Women' -- the great-niece of the Prime Minister of Hyderabad. He fell in love with her and overcame many obstacles to marry her, converting to Islam and, according to Indian sources, becoming a double-agent working against the East India Company.         It is a remarkable story, but such things were not unknown: from the early sixteenth century to the eve of the Indian Mutiny, the 'white Mughals' who wore local dress and adopted Indian ways were a source of embarrassment to successive colonial administrations. Dalrymple unearths such colourful figures as 'Hindoo Stuart', who travelled with his own team of Brahmins to maintain his temple of idols, and Sir David Auchterlony, who took all 13 of his Indian wives out for evening promenades, each on the back of her own elephant.         In 'White Mughals', William Dalrymple discovers a world almost entirely unexplored by history, and places at its centre a compelling tale of seduction and betrayal.||1 online resource||954.8403111|ebook - ebook|05/31/2012|2012-05-31|https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9780007440962?s=MD|http://books.google.com/books/content?id=j8Y73BPvz70C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Robert Kiyosaki.||Kiyosaki, Robert|Kiyosaki, Robert T.||Nonfiction., Business., Finance., Electronic books.||It's estimated that there are over 50 million pensioners-in the United States alone. Like the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Italy, Germany and many other countries around the world are all in big trouble when it comes to the solvency of their pension funds. Who Stole My Pension? was written to give them guidance, resources, and tools so they can take action... and stop the looting. We are in the early stages of the greatest retirement crisis in the history of our nation and, indeed, the entire world. According to the World Health Organization, nearly two billion people around the world are expected to be over age 60 by 2050, a figure that's more than triple what it was in 2000. For better or for worse, never before have there been more elderly people living on planet Earth. One thing is. certain: Doing nothing-sitting back, confident your pension check is in the mail-is not an option. That's a risk you can't afford to take. According to Edward Siedle, a former attorney with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and America's leading expert in pension looting, In the decades to come, we will witness hundreds of millions of elders worldwide, including America's Baby Boomers, slipping into poverty. Too frail to work, too poor to retire will become the new normal for many of the aged. Kiyosaki, who like Siedle saw this crisis looming years ago, complements the facts and stats Siedle puts forth with strategies on how retirees can take control-not only their pensions, but their financial futures. Kiyosaki writes about the fact that his father, a highly educated man he calls his poor dad, wasn't poor until he lost his job, his paycheck-and his pension. His PHD couldn't save him, says Kiyosaki, who has dedicated his life to teaching and financial literacy advocacy. In Who Stole My Pension? the authors focus on the most misunderstood and ignored cause of the pension crisis: mismanagement of pensions and investments. The culprits that are looting the pensions of public school teachers, firefighters, police, as well as private sector workers, are on Wall Street. The Wall Street casinos charging high fees for gambling in risky hedge funds and other speculative investments, outrageous investment-industry conflicts of interest, and outright violations of the law. Who Stole My Pension? is an in-depth assessment of the pension crisis that the world is facing today and what millions around the world-employees who expected to have pension income at retirement-can do about it. The authors recount a history of pension failures, inexperienced boards, gambling, looting and other horror stories-with a focus on action steps workers and retirees can take to quickly determine if a pension is being mismanaged as well as the concrete steps they can take to end decades of pension mismanagement. They detail critical questions retirees can ask-and guidance regarding how to act on what they learn.|Title from eBook information screen..|1 online resource||331.2520973|ebook - ebook|01/14/2020||https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/9781612681047?s=MD|
